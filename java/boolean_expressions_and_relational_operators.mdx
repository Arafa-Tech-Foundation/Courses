# Module 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements

## Lesson 1: Boolean Expressions and Relational Operators

Welcome to the first lesson of Module 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements. In this lesson, we'll learn about Boolean expressions and relational operators in Java.

### Boolean Expressions and Their Evaluation

In Java, a Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value (true or false). Boolean expressions are used in control statements to determine the flow of program execution.

Boolean expressions can consist of variables, constants, and operators. For example, the expression `x > y` is a Boolean expression that evaluates to `true` if `x` is greater than `y`, and `false` otherwise.

### Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare two values and evaluate to a Boolean value. Java supports the following relational operators:

- `<` less than
- `>` greater than
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `==` equal to
- `!=` not equal to

For example, the expression `x > y` uses the greater than (`>`) operator to compare the values of `x` and `y`.

### Compound Boolean Expressions

You can create compound Boolean expressions by using logical operators such as `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT).

For example, the expression `x > y && z > y` is a compound Boolean expression that evaluates to `true` if `x` is greater than `y` and `z` is greater than `y`.

### Short-Circuit Evaluation

Java uses short-circuit evaluation to improve the performance of compound Boolean expressions. In short-circuit evaluation, if the result of a Boolean expression can be determined by evaluating only the left side of the expression, the right side of the expression is not evaluated.

For example, if the left side of a `&&` expression evaluates to `false`, the right side of the expression is not evaluated, because the result of the `&&` expression will always be `false`.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates the use of Boolean expressions and relational operators in Java:

```java
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
int z = 7;

if (x > y) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than y");
} else {
    System.out.println("x is not greater than y");
}

if (x > y && z > y) {
    System.out.println("Both conditions are true");
} else {
    System.out.println("At least one condition is false");
}
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about Boolean expressions and relational operators in Java. We also learned how to create compound Boolean expressions using logical operators and how short-circuit evaluation can improve the performance of Boolean expressions. In the next lesson, we'll learn about the if statement and its syntax.
