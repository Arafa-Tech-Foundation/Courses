# Module 1: Primitive Types

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Data Types and Variables

Welcome to Module 1 of our Java programming course! In this module, we'll explore the basics of Java programming starting with primitive data types and variables. Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for building more complex programs.

### Overview of Primitive Data Types in Java

In Java, data types categorize values into different groups. The primitive data types represent the basic building blocks of Java programs. They include:

- `int`: Represents integer values (e.g., -1, 0, 1).
- `double`: Represents floating-point numbers with decimal places (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).
- `char`: Represents a single character (e.g., 'A', 'b', '@').
- `boolean`: Represents a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

### Declaring and Initializing Variables

Variables are named memory locations used to store data. To use a variable, you need to declare and initialize it. Let's look at an example:

```java
int age; // variable declaration
age = 25; // variable initialization
```

In the example above, we declare a variable named `age` of type `int` and initialize it with the value 25. We can also combine the declaration and initialization into a single statement:

```java
int age = 25; // variable declaration and initialization
```

### Numeric Data Types: `int` and `double`

The `int` data type is used to represent whole numbers, while the `double` data type is used for numbers with decimal places. Here's an example:

```java
int quantity = 10;
double price = 9.99;
```

In the code snippet above, we declare and initialize an `int` variable `quantity` with the value 10 and a `double` variable `price` with the value 9.99.

### Character Data Type: `char`

The `char` data type represents a single character. Characters are enclosed in single quotes (''). Here's an example:

```java
char grade = 'A';
char symbol = '@';
```

In the example above, we declare and initialize a `char` variable `grade` with the value 'A' and another `char` variable `symbol` with the value '@'.

### Boolean Data Type: `boolean`

The `boolean` data type represents a boolean value, which can be either `true` or `false`. Here's an example:

```java
boolean isSunny = true;
boolean hasPassedExam = false;
```

In the code snippet above, we declare and initialize a `boolean` variable `isSunny` with the value `true` and a `boolean` variable `hasPassedExam` with the value `false`.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we covered the basics of primitive data types and variables in Java. We explored numeric data types (`int` and `double`), character data type (`char`), and the boolean data type (`boolean`). We also learned how to declare and initialize variables. Having a solid understanding of these concepts will provide a strong foundation for writing Java programs.
