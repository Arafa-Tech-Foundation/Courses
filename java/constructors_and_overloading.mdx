# Module 2: Using Objects

## Lesson 2: Constructors and Overloading

Welcome to Lesson 2 of Module 2: Using Objects. In this lesson, we'll learn about constructors and overloading in Java.

### Constructors

A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects of a class. It has the same name as the class and no return type. When an object is created, the constructor is called automatically.

#### Default Constructors

A default constructor is a constructor with no parameters. It is automatically created by Java if no constructor is explicitly defined in the class. It initializes the instance variables to their default values.

Here's an example of a default constructor:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Default Constructor
    public Person() {
        name = "John Doe";
        age = 0;
    }
}
```

#### Parameterized Constructors

A parameterized constructor is a constructor that takes one or more parameters. It is used to initialize the instance variables to specific values provided by the user.

Here's an example of a parameterized constructor:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Parameterized Constructor
    public Person(String n, int a) {
        name = n;
        age = a;
    }
}
```

#### The this keyword

The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current object. It is often used in constructors to differentiate between the instance variables and the constructor parameters.

Here's an example of using the `this` keyword:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Parameterized Constructor
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

### Method Overloading

Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have two or more methods with the same name but different parameters. The methods can have different parameter types, different numbers of parameters, or both.

Here's an example of method overloading:

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about constructors and overloading in Java. Constructors are used to initialize objects of a class, and can be default or parameterized. The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current object. Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have two or more methods with the same name but different parameters.
