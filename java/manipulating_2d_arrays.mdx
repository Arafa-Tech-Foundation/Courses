# Module 8: 2D Array

## Lesson 2: Manipulating 2D Arrays

Welcome to lesson 2 of Module 8, where we will learn how to manipulate 2D arrays. In the previous lesson, we learned how to create and initialize 2D arrays, as well as how to access and modify their elements. In this lesson, we'll take it a step further and learn how to traverse, search, sort, transpose, and rotate 2D arrays.

### Traversing Rows and Columns of a 2D Array

To traverse a 2D array, we can use nested for loops to iterate over each element of the array. To traverse the rows of a 2D array, we can use the outer loop to iterate over each row, and the inner loop to iterate over each column of the current row. Similarly, to traverse the columns, we can swap the roles of the outer and inner loops. Here is an example of how to traverse a 2D array by rows:

```java
int[][] arr = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};

// Traverse rows
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(arr[i][j] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println(); // Move to the next row
}
```

Output:

```txt
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

### Searching and Sorting 2D Arrays

To search a 2D array, we can use nested for loops to iterate over each element of the array and compare it to the target value. Here is an example of how to search for a value in a 2D array:

```java
int[][] arr = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};

// Search for value 5
boolean found = false;
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
        if (arr[i][j] == 5) {
            found = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (found) {
        break;
    }
}

if (found) {
    System.out.println("Value 5 found!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Value 5 not found!");
}
```

Output:

```txt
Value 5 found!
```

To sort a 2D array, we can use the `Arrays.sort()` method and provide a custom `Comparator` to compare the rows of the array. Here is an example of how to sort a 2D array by the sum of its rows:

```java
int[][] arr = {{3, 2, 1}, {6, 5, 4}, {9, 8, 7}};

// Sort by row sums
Arrays.sort(arr, Comparator.comparingInt(row -> Arrays.stream(row).sum()));

// Print sorted array
for (int[] row : arr) {
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(row));
}
```

Output:

```txt
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9]
```

### Transposing a 2D Array

To transpose a 2D array, we can create a new 2D array with the rows and columns swapped. Here is an example of how to
