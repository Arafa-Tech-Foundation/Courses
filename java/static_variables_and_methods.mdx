# Module 5: Writing Classes

## Lesson 3: Static Variables and Methods

Welcome to the third lesson of Module 5: Writing Classes! In this lesson, we'll learn about static variables and methods in Java.

### Static Variables

Static variables belong to a class, not an instance of the class. That means that all instances of a class share the same static variable. Static variables are declared using the static keyword.

Let's take a look at an example:

```java
public class Person {
    static int numOfPersons = 0;
    String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        numOfPersons++;
    }
}
```

In this example, the static variable `numOfPersons` is incremented each time a new `Person` object is created. Since `numOfPersons` is shared across all instances of the `Person` class, the value of `numOfPersons` will be the same for all objects of the `Person` class.

### Static Methods

Static methods are also associated with a class, not an instance of the class. Static methods can be called directly on the class, without creating an object instance. Static methods are declared using the static keyword.

Let's take a look at an example:

```java
public class Calculator {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `add` method is a static method. The `add` method can be called directly on the `Calculator` class, like this:

```java
int sum = Calculator.add(2, 3);
```

### Class-level vs. Instance-level Access

Static variables and methods can be accessed at the class level or instance level. Class-level access means that the variable or method is accessed directly on the class, while instance-level access means that the variable or method is accessed on an instance of the class.

Let's take a look at an example:

```java
public class Person {
    static int numOfPersons = 0;
    String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        numOfPersons++;
    }

    public static int getNumOfPersons() {
        return numOfPersons;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person1 = new Person("John");
        Person person2 = new Person("Jane");

        // Accessing static variable at the class-level
        int numOfPersons = Person.numOfPersons;
        System.out.println(numOfPersons); // Output: 2

        // Accessing static method at the class-level
        int totalPersons = Person.getNumOfPersons();
        System.out.println(totalPersons); // Output: 2

        // Accessing static variable at the instance-level
        int numOfPersons1 = person1.numOfPersons; // This works but is discouraged
        int numOfPersons2 = person2.numOfPersons; // This works but is discouraged
    }
}
```

In this example, the static variable `numOfPersons` and static method `getNumOfPersons` are accessed at the class-level, while the static variable `numOfPersons` is also accessed at the instance-level.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about static variables and methods in Java. Static variables belong to a class and are shared across all instances of the class, while static methods can be called directly on the class. It's important to understand the difference between class-level and instance-level access to static variables and methods. In the next lesson, we'll learn about arrays in Java.
