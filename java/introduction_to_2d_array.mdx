# Module 8: 2D Array

## Lesson 1: Introduction to 2D Array

Welcome to the first lesson of Module 8, where we'll introduce the concept of 2D arrays and their applications in Java programming.

### Representing tabular data with 2D arrays

2D arrays are a way of representing data in a tabular format, such as a spreadsheet or a matrix. Unlike 1D arrays, which have a single index to access their elements, 2D arrays have two indices: one for the row and another for the column.

### Creating and initializing 2D arrays

To create a 2D array in Java, you need to specify its dimensions, which are the number of rows and columns. Here's an example of how to create a 2D array of size 3x4:

```java
int[][] myArray = new int[3][4];
```

To initialize a 2D array, you can use nested loops to iterate over its elements and assign them values:

```java
int[][] myArray = new int[3][4];

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
        myArray[i][j] = i + j;
    }
}
```

### Accessing and modifying elements

You can access elements of a 2D array using their indices:

```java
int[][] myArray = new int[3][4];

int value = myArray[1][2]; // Accessing the element at row 1, column 2
```

To modify an element, you can use the same syntax:

```java
myArray[1][2] = 42; // Modifying the element at row 1, column 2
```

### Array of arrays vs. rectangular arrays

In Java, 2D arrays can be implemented as an array of arrays or a rectangular array. An array of arrays is a 1D array where each element is another 1D array, while a rectangular array is a single contiguous block of memory.

```java
int[][] array1 = new int[3][4]; // Rectangular array
int[][] array2 = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5}, {6, 7, 8, 9} }; // Array of arrays
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we introduced the concept of 2D arrays and their applications in Java programming. We learned how to create and initialize a 2D array, access and modify its elements, and the difference between an array of arrays and a rectangular array.
