# Module 4: Iteration

## Lesson 1: while Loops

Welcome to the first lesson on iteration in Java! In this lesson, we'll be learning about while loops, which are a fundamental tool for repeating a block of code multiple times.

### The while loop and its syntax

The `while` loop is a basic loop construct in Java, and it has a simple syntax:

```java
while (condition) {
  // loop body
}
```

The loop condition is a boolean expression that is checked before every iteration of the loop. If the condition is `true`, the loop body is executed. If the condition is `false`, the loop terminates.

Let's take a look at an example:

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}
```

This loop will print the numbers 0 to 4, because `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 after each iteration of the loop. The loop condition `i < 5` ensures that the loop will terminate after 5 iterations.

### Loop condition and loop body

It's important to make sure that the loop condition is properly set up, or the loop might not terminate and cause an infinite loop. The loop body is the block of code that is executed as long as the loop condition is true.

### Increment and decrement inside loops

We often use loops to iterate over a range of values or a collection. We can use increment and decrement operators inside the loop to change the loop control variable. Let's see an example:

```java
int i = 10;
while (i > 0) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i--;
}
```

This loop will print the numbers 10 to 1 in descending order. The loop condition `i > 0` ensures that the loop will terminate when `i` reaches 0.

### Infinite loops and loop termination

An infinite loop is a loop that never terminates, and it can crash your program or make it unresponsive. It's important to make sure that the loop condition will eventually become false. If you accidentally create an infinite loop, you can terminate it manually by pressing `Ctrl-C` in the command prompt or using the `break` statement.

```java
while (true) {
  // loop body
  if (condition) {
    break;
  }
}
```

The `break` statement can be used to terminate a loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about while loops and how they are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. We also looked at how to properly set up the loop condition, how to use increment and decrement operators, and how to avoid infinite loops. In the next lesson, we'll be learning about for loops, which are another type of loop construct in Java.
