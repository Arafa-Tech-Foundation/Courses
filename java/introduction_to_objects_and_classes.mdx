# Module 2: Using Objects

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Objects and Classes

Welcome to the first lesson of Module 2, Using Objects! In this lesson, we'll introduce the concept of objects and classes in Java.

### Defining Classes and Objects

In Java, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class. Classes are used to define the properties and behaviors of an object.

Here's an example of defining a class in Java:

```java
public class Car {
    // instance variables
    String make;
    String model;
    int year;

    // methods
    public void start() {
        // code to start the car
    }

    public void stop() {
        // code to stop the car
    }
}
```

In the above example, we've defined a class `Car` with three instance variables (`make`, `model`, `year`) and two methods (`start()` and `stop()`).

### Creating Objects from Classes

Once we have defined a class, we can create objects from that class. Here's an example of creating an object from the `Car` class:

```java
Car myCar = new Car();
```

In the above example, we've created a new `Car` object and assigned it to the variable `myCar`.

### Instance Variables and Methods

Instance variables are properties of an object that hold its state. Methods are functions associated with the object that define its behavior.

Here's an example of accessing instance variables and calling methods on an object:

```java
myCar.make = "Honda";
myCar.model = "Civic";
myCar.year = 2020;

myCar.start();
myCar.stop();
```

In the above example, we've set the `make`, `model`, and `year` instance variables of `myCar`, and called its `start()` and `stop()` methods.

### The Dot Operator

In Java, we use the dot operator (`.`) to access instance variables and methods of an object. For example:

```java
String carMake = myCar.make;
myCar.start();
```

In the above example, we're accessing the `make` instance variable of `myCar` and calling its `start()` method using the dot operator.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we've introduced the concept of objects and classes in Java. We've learned how to define classes, create objects from those classes, and access instance variables and methods using the dot operator. In the next lesson, we'll learn about constructors and overloading.
