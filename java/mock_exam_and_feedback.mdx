# Module 11: Conclusion and Exam Preparation

## Lesson 3: Mock Exam and Feedback

Welcome to the final lesson of the AP Computer Science A course! In this lesson, we will take a full-length mock exam under timed conditions and receive personalized feedback to identify areas for improvement.

### Mock Exam

Before taking the mock exam, make sure you have a quiet and comfortable space to work, and that you have allocated enough time to complete the entire exam. The mock exam will consist of multiple-choice questions and free-response questions, similar to the actual AP exam.

#### Multiple-Choice Questions

The multiple-choice section of the mock exam will test your knowledge of various programming concepts and syntax. You will have 90 minutes to answer 40 questions. To maximize your score on this section, make sure you read each question carefully and understand what is being asked before selecting an answer.

#### Free-Response Questions

The free-response section of the mock exam will test your ability to apply programming concepts to real-world problems. You will have 90 minutes to complete four questions. To maximize your score on this section, make sure you read each question carefully, plan your solution before writing any code, and write clear and concise code.

### Feedback and Improvement

After completing the mock exam, review your answers and solutions carefully to identify areas for improvement. Pay attention to the types of errors you made and try to understand why you made them. You may also want to seek feedback from a teacher or tutor to help you identify areas for improvement.

To help you improve your programming skills, we have provided some practice exercises and code debugging problems below.

#### Practice Exercises

1. Write a Java program that prints all even numbers from 1 to 100.
2. Write a Java program that calculates and prints the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 50.
3. Write a Java program that takes an integer as input and checks if it is a prime number.

#### Code Debugging Problems

1. The following Java program is supposed to print all the prime numbers between 1 and 20. However, it contains several errors. Identify and correct the errors.

   ```java
   for (int i = 2; i <= 20; i++) {
    for (int j = 2; j < i; j++) {
      if (i % j == 0) {
       System.out.println(i);
       break;
      }
    }
   }
   ```

2. The following Java program is supposed to print the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 10. However, it contains several errors. Identify and correct the errors.

   ```java
   int sum = 0;
   for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
      sum = sum + i;
    }
   }
   System.out.println(sum);
   ```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we took a full-length mock exam under timed conditions and received personalized feedback to identify areas for improvement. We also provided some practice exercises and code debugging problems to help you improve your programming skills. Remember to review the main topics and syntax covered in the course and to utilize effective problem-solving strategies to succeed on the AP exam. Good luck!
