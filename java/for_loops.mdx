# Module 4: Iteration

## Lesson 2: for Loops

Welcome to lesson 2 of Module 4. In this lesson, we'll learn about for loops in Java. A for loop is a control flow statement that allows us to repeatedly execute a block of code until a specified condition is met.

## Syntax

The basic syntax for a for loop in Java is:

```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

- `initialization` is where we initialize the loop variable.
- `condition` is the condition that is checked before each iteration of the loop.
- `update` is the statement that is executed after each iteration of the loop.

## Example

Let's take a look at an example of a for loop that prints the numbers 1 to 5.

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

The loop initializes the variable `i` to 1, checks that `i` is less than or equal to 5, and increments `i` by 1 after each iteration. The loop body simply prints the value of `i` to the console.

## Iterating over Arrays

For loops are commonly used to iterate over arrays in Java. Here's an example that prints all the elements of an array of integers:

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
```

The loop initializes the variable `i` to 0, checks that `i` is less than the length of the `numbers` array, and increments `i` by 1 after each iteration. The loop body prints the value of `numbers[i]` to the console.

## Nested for Loops

For loops can be nested inside other for loops to create more complex iterations. Here's an example that prints a multiplication table:

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 10; j++) {
        System.out.print(i*j + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

The outer loop initializes the variable `i` to 1, checks that `i` is less than or equal to 10, and increments `i` by 1 after each iteration. The inner loop initializes the variable `j` to 1, checks that `j` is less than or equal to 10, and increments `j` by 1 after each iteration. The loop body prints the product of `i` and `j`, followed by a space. The `System.out.println()` statement is used to print a newline after each row of the multiplication table.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about for loops in Java. We learned how to use them to iterate over arrays and create nested loops for more complex iterations. In the next lesson, we'll learn about do-while loops and loop control statements.
