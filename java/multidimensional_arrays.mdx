## Lesson 3: Multidimensional Arrays

Welcome to Lesson 3 of Module 6: Array. In this lesson, we'll learn about multidimensional arrays, which are arrays with more than one dimension. We'll see how to create, initialize, and traverse a 2D array, work with jagged arrays, and create an array of objects.

### Creating and Accessing Multidimensional Arrays

A multidimensional array is an array of arrays. To create a 2D array, we can use the following syntax:

```java
int[][] myArray = new int[3][4];
```

This creates a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns. We can also create an array of arrays explicitly like this:

```java
int[][] myArray = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}, {10, 11, 12}};
```

To access an element of a 2D array, we can use two indexes: one for the row and one for the column. For example, to access the element in the second row and third column of `myArray`, we can use the following syntax:

```java
int element = myArray[1][2]; // element is 6
```

### Initializing and Traversing a 2D Array

We can initialize a 2D array using nested loops. For example, to initialize a 3x3 array with the values of the multiplication table, we can use the following code:

```java
int[][] multiplicationTable = new int[3][3];
for (int i = 0; i < multiplicationTable.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < multiplicationTable[i].length; j++) {
        multiplicationTable[i][j] = (i + 1) * (j + 1);
    }
}
```

To traverse a 2D array, we can use nested loops as well. For example, to print the elements of `myArray`, we can use the following code:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < myArray[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(myArray[i][j] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

### Working with Jagged Arrays

A jagged array is a multidimensional array in which the rows have different lengths. To create a jagged array, we can use the following syntax:

```java
int[][] jaggedArray = {{1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}, {6, 7, 8, 9}};
```

To traverse a jagged array, we need to use the length of each row explicitly:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < jaggedArray.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < jaggedArray[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(jaggedArray[i][j] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```

### Array of Objects

We can create an array of objects just like we create an array of any other type. For example, to create an array of `Person` objects, we can use the following code:

```java
Person[] people = new Person[3];
people[0] = new Person("Alice", 25);
people[1] = new Person("Bob", 30);
people[2] = new Person("Charlie", 35);
```

To access the elements of the array, we can use the following syntax:

```java
Person person = people[0];
String name = person.getName(); // name is "Alice"
int age = person.getAge(); // age is 25
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about multidimensional arrays, which are arrays with more than one dimension. We saw how to create, initialize, and traverse a 2D array, work with jagged arrays, and create an array of objects.
