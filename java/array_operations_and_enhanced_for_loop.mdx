# Module 6: Array

## Lesson 2: Array Operations and Enhanced for Loop

Welcome to Lesson 2 of Module 6! In this lesson, we'll explore some of the most common operations that can be performed on arrays, as well as the enhanced for loop (for-each loop).

### Array Manipulation Operations

Arrays are a versatile data structure that can be manipulated in various ways to suit specific programming needs. Here are some common operations that can be performed on arrays:

#### 1. Adding Elements to an Array

To add an element to an array, you can use the `Arrays.copyOf()` method to create a new array with a larger size, and then add the new element to the end of the new array.

```java
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
int[] newArr = Arrays.copyOf(arr, arr.length + 1);
newArr[arr.length] = 4;
```

#### 2. Removing Elements from an Array

To remove an element from an array, you can use the `System.arraycopy()` method to create a new array with the removed element.

```java
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
int[] newArr = new int[arr.length - 1];
System.arraycopy(arr, 0, newArr, 0, 2);
System.arraycopy(arr, 3, newArr, 2, 1);
```

#### 3. Copying Arrays

To create a copy of an array, you can use the `Arrays.copyOf()` method or the `System.arraycopy()` method.

```java
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
int[] copyArr = Arrays.copyOf(arr, arr.length);
```

#### 4. Searching and Sorting Arrays

To search for an element in an array, you can use the `Arrays.binarySearch()` method. To sort an array, you can use the `Arrays.sort()` method.

```java
int[] arr = {4, 1, 3, 2};
Arrays.sort(arr);
int index = Arrays.binarySearch(arr, 3);
```

### Enhanced for Loop (for-each loop)

The enhanced for loop, also known as the for-each loop, provides an easy way to iterate over all elements in an array. The enhanced for loop is only used for iterating over arrays and collections, and cannot be used for other types of loops.

Here's an example of how to use the enhanced for loop to iterate over an array:

```java
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
for (int element : arr) {
    System.out.println(element);
}
```

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we explored some of the common operations that can be performed on arrays, including adding and removing elements, copying arrays, and searching and sorting arrays. We also introduced the enhanced for loop, which provides a convenient way to iterate over all elements in an array.
