# Module 5: Writing Classes

## Lesson 1: Class Design and Object-Oriented Concepts

Welcome to the first lesson of Module 5: Writing Classes. In this lesson, we will cover class design principles and object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

### Class Design Principles

Class design principles are essential for writing maintainable and reusable code. Two key principles of class design are cohesion and coupling.

- Cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements of a class are related to each other. A class with high cohesion contains elements that are closely related and work together to achieve a specific purpose.
- Coupling refers to the degree to which one class depends on another class. Low coupling between classes means that changes in one class will have minimal impact on other classes.

The single responsibility principle is another important class design principle. It states that a class should have only one reason to change. This principle helps to ensure that classes are focused and have clear responsibilities.

### Object-Oriented Concepts

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent real-world entities and concepts. Some key concepts in object-oriented programming include:

- Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class.
- Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects to take on different forms or behaviors based on their context.
- Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of hiding unnecessary details and complexity from users.

Let's take a look at an example class to illustrate these concepts:

```java
public class Animal {
   private String name;

   public Animal(String name) {
      this.name = name;
   }

   public String getName() {
      return name;
   }

   public void eat() {
      System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
   }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
   public Dog(String name) {
      super(name);
   }

   @Override
   public void eat() {
      System.out.println(getName() + " is eating dog food.");
   }
}

public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Animal animal = new Animal("Generic Animal");
      animal.eat();

      Dog dog = new Dog("Fido");
      dog.eat();
   }
}
```

In this example, we have an Animal class that has a name field and an eat() method. We also have a Dog class that inherits from the Animal class and overrides the eat() method. The Main class creates instances of both Animal and Dog and calls their eat() methods.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we covered class design principles and object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing maintainable and reusable code.
