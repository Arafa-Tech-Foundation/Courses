# Module 0: Installing Java / Setting up IDE

## Lesson 3: Hello World

Welcome to the third lesson of the Installing Java and Setting up IDE module! In this lesson, we'll create our first Java program, the Hello World program, and learn how to run it.

### Creating our Main.java file

In Java, a program consists of one or more classes. Each class is defined in a separate file with the same name as the class and a `.java` extension. We'll create a file named `Main.java` in a new folder named `HelloWorld`.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
```

### Writing a `main` method

In Java, every program must have a `main` method. The `main` method is the entry point of the program, and it's the first method that gets executed when we run our program.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // code goes here
}
```

### Printing to the console

To print output to the console in Java, we use the `System.out.println()` method. This method takes a string as an argument and prints it to the console.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```

### Running the program

To run our program, we need to compile it first. We can do this using the `javac` command followed by the name of our Java file.

```sh
javac Main.java
```

This will compile our program and generate a `.class` file with the same name as our class. To run our program, we use the `java` command followed by the name of our class.

```sh
java Main
```

This will execute our program, and we should see the output `Hello, World!` in the console.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we created our first Java program, the Hello World program, and learned how to run it. We learned about the `main` method, printing to the console, and compiling and executing our program. In the next module, we'll dive deeper into Java data types and variables.
