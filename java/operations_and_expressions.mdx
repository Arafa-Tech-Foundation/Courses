## Lesson 2: Operations and Expressions

Welcome to Lesson 2 of Module 1: Primitive Types. In this lesson, we'll learn about the different operators and expressions used in Java.

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations in Java. Here are the basic arithmetic operators:

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulus: `%`

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 5;

int sum = a + b;
int difference = a - b;
int product = a * b;
int quotient = a / b;
int remainder = a % b;
```

### Operator Precedence and Associativity

Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. If operators have the same precedence, their associativity determines the order of evaluation. In Java, operators are evaluated from left to right, except for assignment operators, which are evaluated from right to left.

```java
int result = 10 + 20 * 2; // result = 50
```

### Increment and Decrement Operators

Increment and decrement operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1. There are two types of increment and decrement operators:

- Pre-increment/decrement: ++x, --x
- Post-increment/decrement: x++, x--

```java
int x = 5;

int y = ++x; // y = 6, x = 6
int z = x--; // z = 6, x = 5
```

### Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare values in Java. Here are the relational operators:

- Less than: `<`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Equal to: `==`
- Not equal to: `!=`

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 5;

boolean result1 = a > b; // true
boolean result2 = a <= b; // false
boolean result3 = a == b; // false
```

### Boolean Operators

Boolean operators are used to perform logical operations in Java. Here are the boolean operators:

- Logical AND: `&&`
- Logical OR: `||`
- Logical NOT: `!`

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 5;

boolean result1 = (a > b) && (a < 20); // true
boolean result2 = (a > b) || (b == 5); // true
boolean result3 = !(a > b); // false
```

### String Concatenation

String concatenation is used to combine two or more strings into one string. In Java, string concatenation is performed using the + operator.

```java
String firstName = "John";
String lastName = "Doe";

String fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // "John Doe"
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about the different operators and expressions used in Java. We covered arithmetic operators, operator precedence and associativity, increment and decrement operators, relational operators, boolean operators, and string concatenation.
