# Module 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements

## Lesson 2: if Statements and Block Statements

### Introduction

In this lesson, we'll learn about the `if` statement and its syntax. The `if` statement is a fundamental control structure in programming and is used to conditionally execute code based on a boolean expression.

### The if Statement and its Syntax

The syntax of the `if` statement is as follows:

```java
if (boolean_expression) {
    // code to execute if the boolean_expression is true
}
```

The `if` statement evaluates the boolean expression in parentheses. If the expression evaluates to `true`, the code block inside the curly braces is executed. If the expression evaluates to `false`, the code block is skipped.

Here's an example of using the `if` statement to conditionally execute code:

```java
int x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
}
```

In this example, the boolean expression `x > 5` evaluates to `true` because `x` is equal to `10`, which is greater than `5`. Therefore, the code inside the `if` block is executed, which prints the message "x is greater than 5" to the console.

### if-else Statement

In addition to the `if` statement, there's also an `if-else` statement. The `if-else` statement allows you to execute one block of code if the boolean expression is true, and another block of code if the boolean expression is false.

Here's an example of using the `if-else` statement:

```java
int x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("x is less than or equal to 5");
}
```

In this example, because `x` is greater than `5`, the boolean expression evaluates to `true`. Therefore, the code block inside the first set of curly braces is executed, and the message "x is greater than 5" is printed to the console.

### Nested if Statements

You can also nest `if` statements inside other `if` statements. This is useful when you need to check multiple conditions.

Here's an example of using nested `if` statements:

```java
int x = 10;
int y = 20;

if (x > 5) {
    if (y > 15) {
        System.out.println("x is greater than 5 and y is greater than 15");
    }
}
```

In this example, the outer `if` statement checks if `x` is greater than `5`. If that condition is true, the inner `if` statement checks if `y` is greater than `15`. If both conditions are true, the code inside the inner `if` block is executed, and the message "x is greater than 5 and y is greater than 15" is printed to the console.

### The switch Statement

Another way to perform conditional execution is with the `switch` statement. The `switch` statement is useful when you need to compare a single value against multiple possible values.

Here's an example of using the `switch` statement:

```java
int dayOfWeek = 2;

switch (dayOfWeek) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid day of week");
}
```

In this example we have a variable called `dayOfWeek` that stores the value `2`. The `switch` statement compares this value against the possible values `1`, `2`, and `3`. Because the value is `2`, the second `case` statement is executed, which prints the message "Tuesday" to the console.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about the `if` statement and its syntax. We also learned about the `if-else` statement, nested `if` statements, and the `switch` statement.
