# Module 0: Installing Java / Setting up IDE

## Lesson 2: Setting up IDE

Welcome back to Module 0 of our Java programming course! In the previous lesson, we learned how to install Java JDK and JRE on our computer. Now, it's time to set up our Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and execute Java code. Let's get started!

### Introduction to IDE

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive tools and features to streamline the process of writing, debugging, and running code. IDEs offer features like code editors, syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging tools, and project management capabilities.

In this lesson, we will be using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as our IDE for Java development. VSCode is a lightweight yet powerful source code editor that provides excellent support for various programming languages, including Java.

#### Steps to Install VSCode

1. Visit the VSCode website at [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

#### Installing Java Extension Pack

To enhance the Java development experience in VSCode, we will install the Java Extension Pack. This extension pack includes a set of essential tools and extensions for Java development, such as language support, code snippets, debugging capabilities, and more.

#### Steps to Install Java Extension Pack

1. Open VSCode.
2. Click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (`Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS) to open the Extensions view.
3. Search for "Java Extension Pack" in the Extensions view search box.
4. Click on the "Java Extension Pack" result, and then click the "Install" button.
5. Wait for the installation to complete, and once finished, you're ready to start coding Java in VSCode!

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and the Java Extension Pack. You now have a powerful IDE to write, debug, and run your Java code.
