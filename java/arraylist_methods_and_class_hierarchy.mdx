# Module 7: ArrayList

## Lesson 3: ArrayList Methods and Class Hierarchy

Welcome to the third lesson of the ArrayList module! In this lesson, we'll learn about some common ArrayList methods and the class hierarchy of ArrayList.

### ArrayList Methods

ArrayList provides several methods that make it easy to work with collections of objects. Let's look at some of the most common ArrayList methods:

#### size()

The size() method returns the number of elements in the ArrayList.

```java
ArrayList<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
fruits.add("apple");
fruits.add("banana");
fruits.add("orange");
int size = fruits.size(); // returns 3
```

#### get()

The get() method returns the element at the specified index.

```java
String fruit = fruits.get(1); // returns "banana"
```

#### set()

The set() method replaces the element at the specified index with the specified element.

```java
fruits.set(0, "pear");
// fruits is now ["pear", "banana", "orange"]
```

#### remove()

The remove() method removes the element at the specified index.

```java
fruits.remove(2);
// fruits is now ["pear", "banana"]
```

#### clear()

The clear() method removes all elements from the ArrayList.

```java
fruits.clear();
// fruits is now []
```

### ArrayList Class Hierarchy

ArrayList is a class that is part of the Java Collections Framework, which provides a set of classes and interfaces for working with collections of objects. ArrayList extends the AbstractList class, which provides a basic implementation of the List interface. The List interface extends the Collection interface, which is the root interface of the Java Collections Framework.

Here's a diagram of the class hierarchy of ArrayList:

```txt
       Object
         |
     AbstractCollection
         |
     AbstractList
         |
      ArrayList
```

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about some common ArrayList methods and the class hierarchy of ArrayList. ArrayList is a powerful class that makes it easy to work with collections of objects. In the next module, we'll learn about 2D arrays and how to manipulate them in Java.
