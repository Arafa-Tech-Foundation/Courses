# Module 11: Conclusion and Exam Preparation

## Lesson 2: Strategies for AP Exam Success

Welcome to Lesson 2 of Module 11! In this lesson, we'll go over some strategies for success on the AP Computer Science A exam. The exam is designed to test your knowledge of fundamental programming concepts and skills, as well as your ability to apply those concepts to solve problems.

### Understanding the AP Exam

The AP Computer Science A exam consists of two sections: multiple-choice and free-response. The multiple-choice section consists of 40 questions and is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. The free-response section consists of 4 questions and is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.

The multiple-choice section tests your knowledge of programming concepts and syntax, while the free-response section tests your ability to write and analyze code to solve problems.

### Time Management Techniques

It's important to manage your time effectively during the exam to ensure that you can complete all the questions within the allotted time. For the multiple-choice section, aim to spend about 2 minutes per question. If you get stuck on a question, skip it and come back to it later.

For the free-response section, start with the question that you feel most confident about and work on the others afterward. Each free-response question is worth 9-10 points, so allocate your time accordingly. Be sure to read each question carefully and understand what it's asking before you start writing your solution.

### Problem-Solving Strategies

When you're working on the free-response questions, it's essential to have a problem-solving strategy. One approach is to use the following steps:

1. Understand the problem: read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand what it's asking you to do.
2. Design a solution: plan your approach and pseudocode the solution.
3. Implement the solution: write the code to solve the problem.
4. Test the solution: test your code with various inputs to make sure it works correctly.

### Utilizing the AP Computer Science A GridWorld Case Study

The AP Computer Science A GridWorld Case Study is a set of classes and interfaces that simulate a world of actors and grids. The case study is designed to help you learn and apply fundamental programming concepts such as inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.

You should practice working with the GridWorld Case Study and familiarize yourself with its classes and methods. This will help you better understand the types of problems you may encounter on the exam and give you the tools to solve them effectively.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we reviewed some strategies for success on the AP Computer Science A exam. Effective time management, problem-solving strategies, and familiarity with the GridWorld Case Study are all key to success on the exam. In the next lesson, we'll take a full-length mock exam under timed conditions and review the answers and solutions.
