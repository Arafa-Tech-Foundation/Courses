# Module 3: Functions and Parameter Passing in C++
## Lesson: Functions in C++

Functions are an essential part of any programming language. They allow segments of code to be reused, organized, and encapsulated. In C++, a function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. It can be called from anywhere in the program, receive arguments or parameters, and return a value if necessary. In this lesson, we will learn the basics of functions in C++, their syntax, and different ways of parameter passing.

### Syntax of a Function
A function in C++ is declared using the following syntax:

```
return_type function_name(parameters){
    // code block to be executed
    return value;
}
```

* **return_type** – the type of data that the function returns. It can be any data type or void if the function does not return anything.
* **function_name** – the name that you give to the function. It should be unique and descriptive of what the function does.
* **parameters** – the variables that receive input from the caller. Parameters are optional, but if you need to pass data to the function, you will use them.
* **code block** – the instructions that the function will perform. 
* **return value** – the value that the function will send back to the caller. It is optional and depends on the return type of the function.

Here is an example of a simple function that adds two numbers and returns the result:
```cpp
int add(int x, int y){
    int result = x + y;
    return result;
}
```

The function name is "add," and it receives two integers as parameters "x" and "y." The code block inside the function adds x and y, stores the result in a variable called "result," and returns it to the caller.

### Calling a Function
Once a function is defined, it can be called later in the program. To call a function, you need to use its name followed by parentheses and any arguments if required. Here is an example of a function call with arguments:

```cpp
int a = 2;
int b = 3;
int c = add(a, b);
```

The values of "a" and "b" are passed as arguments to the function "add," which returns the value "5" and assigns it to the variable "c."

### Parameter Passing
In C++, there are two ways of passing arguments to a function - Pass by Value, and Pass by Reference.

#### Pass by Value
In Pass by Value, a copy of the variable is passed to the function. The function works with the copy and changes made to the copy do not affect the original value outside the function. Here is an example:

```cpp
void increment(int value){
    value++; // This only changes the local copy
}

int main(){
    int a = 10;
    increment(a);
    cout << a; // Output: 10
}
```

The increment function receives an integer value and increments it by one. However, since it is passed by value, only the copy inside the function is changed, and the original value in main remains the same.

#### Pass by Reference
In Pass by Reference, the address of the variable is passed to the function. The function works with the original variable, and any changes made inside the function affect the original value. Here is an example:

```cpp
void increment(int& value){
    value++; // This changes the original value
}

int main(){
    int a = 10;
    increment(a);
    cout << a; // Output: 11
}
```

The difference between this example and the previous one is the & symbol after the data type of the parameter, which makes it a reference. Now, when the Increment function runs, it modifies the original value "a."

### Conclusion
Functions are powerful tools in C++ that help to make the code modular, reusable, and more organized. They can receive arguments or parameters, return values, and use different ways of parameter passing. Always choose the appropriate way of passing parameters depending on the requirements of the program. In the next lesson, we will learn about default arguments and function overloading.
