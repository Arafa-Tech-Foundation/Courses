# Module 4: Object-Oriented Programming in C++

## Lesson: Classes and Objects in C++

### Introduction
In C++, classes are used to group related variables and functions together to form a single unit called an object. This is a powerful concept called **encapsulation** that makes it possible to organize a program into objects that interact with each other, making the code more manageable, understandable, and reusable.

### Declaring a Class
To declare a class, we use the keyword `class` followed by the name of the class. A class declaration typically includes two parts: a public section and a private section.
```CPP
class MyClass {
  // public section (members accessible from outside)
  public:
    // constructor
    MyClass(int arg1, int arg2);
    // member function
    void myFunction();
  // private section (members accessible only from within the class)
  private:
    // data member
    int myVariable;
};
```

#### Constructor
A constructor is a special member function that is called automatically when an object is created. Its purpose is to initialize the object’s data members. The constructor has the same name as the class and no return type. Here is an example of a constructor for the class `MyClass`:
```CPP
MyClass::MyClass(int arg1, int arg2) {
  // initialize data members
  myVariable = arg1 + arg2;
}
```

#### Member Function
A member function is a function that belongs to a class and can access the object's data members. It has the same syntax as a regular function, with the addition of the class name and the `::` operator. Here is an example of a member function for the class `MyClass`.
```CPP
void MyClass::myFunction() {
  // access data members
  cout << "My variable is " << myVariable << endl;
}
```

#### Data Member
A data member is a variable that is declared inside a class. It is accessible only from within the class and its member functions. Data members can be of any type, such as `int`, `float`, `string`, or even another class. Here is an example of a data member for the class `MyClass`.
```CPP
int MyClass::myVariable;
```

### Creating Objects
To create an object of a class, we use the class name followed by the object name and parentheses. Here is an example of creating an object of the class `MyClass`.
```CPP
MyClass myObject(5, 10);
```

### Accessing Members
To access the members of a class, we use the dot operator `.` followed by the member name. Here is an example of accessing a member function and data member of the object `myObject`.
```CPP
myObject.myFunction();
cout << myObject.myVariable << endl;
```

### Example Program
```CPP
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Rectangle {
  // public section
  public:
    // constructor
    Rectangle(int w, int h);
    // member function
    int area();
  // private section
  private:
    // data members
    int width;
    int height;
};

// constructor definition
Rectangle::Rectangle(int w, int h) {
  width = w;
  height = h;
}

// member function definition
int Rectangle::area() {
  return width * height;
}

// main function
int main() {
  // create an object
  Rectangle rect(3, 4);
  // access member function
  cout << "Area: " << rect.area() << endl;
  // access data member
  cout << "Width: " << rect.width << endl; // error: private member
  return 0;
}
```

### Conclusion
In this lesson, we have learned the basics of classes and objects in C++. We have learned how to declare a class, create objects, and access the members of a class. We have also seen an example program using the class `Rectangle`. By encapsulating related data and functions in a class, we can create powerful and flexible programs that are easy to maintain and reuse.
