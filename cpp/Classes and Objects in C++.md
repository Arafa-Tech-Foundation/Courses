# Module 4: Object-Oriented Programming in C++

## Lesson: Classes and Objects in C++

### Introduction
In C++, classes are used to group related variables and functions together to form a single unit called an object. This is a powerful concept called **encapsulation** that makes it possible to organize a program into objects that interact with each other, making the code more manageable, understandable, and reusable.

### Declaring a Class
To declare a class, we use the keyword `class` followed by the name of the class. A class declaration typically includes two parts: a public section and a private section.
```CPP
class MyClass {
  // public section (members accessible from outside)
  public:
    // constructor
    MyClass(int arg1, int arg2);
    // member function
    void myFunction();
  // private section (members accessible only from within the class)
  private:
    // data member
    int myVariable;
};
```

#### Constructor
A constructor is a special member function that is called automatically when an object is created. Its purpose is to initialize the objectâ€™s data members. The constructor has the same name as the class and no return type. Here is an example of a constructor for the class `MyClass`:
```CPP
MyClass::MyClass(int arg1, int arg2) {
  // initialize data members
  myVariable = arg1 + arg2;
}
```

#### Member Function
A member function is a function that belongs to a class and can access the object's data members. It has the same syntax as a regular function, with the addition of the class name and the `::` operator. Here is an example of a member function for the class `MyClass`.
```CPP
void MyClass::myFunction() {
  // access data members
  cout << "My variable is " << myVariable << endl;
}
```

#### Data Member
A data member is a variable that is declared inside a class. It is accessible only from within the class and its member functions. Data members can be of any type, such as `int`, `float`, `string`, or even another class. Here is an example of a data member for the class `MyClass`.
```CPP
int MyClass::myVariable;
```

### Creating Objects
To create an object of a class, we use the class name followed by the object name and parentheses. Here is an example of creating an object of the class `MyClass`.
```CPP
MyClass myObject(5, 10);
```

### Accessing Members
To access the members of a class, we use the dot operator `.` followed by the member name. Here is an example of accessing a member function and data member of the object `myObject`.
```CPP
myObject.myFunction();
cout << myObject.myVariable << endl;
```

### Example Program
```CPP
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Rectangle {
  // public section
  public:
    // constructor
    Rectangle(int w, int h);
    // member function
    int area();
  // private section
  private:
    // data members
    int width;
    int height;
};

// constructor definition
Rectangle::Rectangle(int w, int h) {
  width = w;
  height = h;
}

// member function definition
int Rectangle::area() {
  return width * height;
}

// main function
int main() {
  // create an object
  Rectangle rect(3, 4);
  // access member function
  cout << "Area: " << rect.area() << endl;
  // access data member
  cout << "Width: " << rect.width << endl; // error: private member
  return 0;
}
```

### Conclusion
In this lesson, we have learned the basics of classes and objects in C++. We have learned how to declare a class, create objects, and access the members of a class. We have also seen an example program using the class `Rectangle`. By encapsulating related data and functions in a class, we can create powerful and flexible programs that are easy to maintain and reuse.
