# Module 2: Control Structures in C++
## Lesson: Conditional Statements in C++

In programming, conditional statements are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. They allow the program to execute different sets of instructions depending on whether a particular condition is true or false. In this lesson, we will discuss the conditional statements in C++.

### If Statement
The if statement is one of the most basic conditional statements in C++. It allows you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true. The general syntax for an if statement is as follows:

```c++
if (condition) {
    //code to execute if condition is true
}
```

For example, we can use an if statement to check if a number is even or odd. 

```c++
int num = 10;
if (num % 2 == 0) {
    std::cout << num << " is even";
}
```

In this example, the condition `num % 2 == 0` checks if `num` is divisible by 2 (i.e., even). If the condition is true, the code inside the curly braces `{}` is executed and it prints `10 is even` on the console.

### If-Else Statement
The if-else statement allows you to execute a block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false. The general syntax for an if-else statement is as follows:

```c++
if (condition) {
    //code to execute if condition is true
}
else {
    //code to execute if condition is false
}
```

For example, we can use an if-else statement to check whether a number is positive or negative.

```c++
int num = -10;
if (num >= 0) {
    std::cout << num << " is positive";
}
else {
    std::cout << num << " is negative";
}
```

In this example, the condition `num >= 0` checks if `num` is greater than or equal to zero. If the condition is true, it prints `10 is positive` and if the condition is false, it prints `10 is negative`.

### If-Else If Statement
The if-else if statement allows you to check multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on them. The general syntax for an if-else if statement is as follows:

```c++
if (condition1) {
    //code to execute if condition1 is true
}
else if (condition2) {
    //code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
}
else {
    //code to execute if all conditions are false
}
```

For example, we can use an if-else if statement to check the grade of a student based on their marks.

```c++
int marks = 80;
if (marks >= 90) {
    std::cout << "A grade";
}
else if (marks >= 80) {
    std::cout << "B grade";
}
else if (marks >= 70) {
    std::cout << "C grade";
}
else {
    std::cout << "Fail";
}
```

In this example, the code checks the marks of the student and prints the corresponding grade on the console. If the marks are greater than or equal to 90, it prints `A grade`, if the marks are between 80 and 90, it prints `B grade`, if the marks are between 70 and 80, it prints `C grade`, and if the marks are below 70, it prints `Fail`.

### Ternary Operator
The ternary operator is also known as the conditional operator. It is used to assign a value to a variable based on a condition. The general syntax for the ternary operator is as follows:

```c++
variable = (condition) ? expression1 : expression2;
```

If the condition is true, `expression1` is assigned to `variable`, otherwise `expression2` is assigned to `variable`.

For example, we can use a ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative.

```c++
int num = -10;
std::string result = (num >= 0) ? "positive" : "negative";
std::cout << num << " is " << result;
```

In this example, the code checks if `num` is greater than or equal to zero using a ternary operator. If it is true, the value `"positive"` is assigned to `result`, otherwise `"negative"` is assigned. The final output on the console is `10 is negative`.

### Conclusion
Conditional statements are an important concept in almost all programming languages, including C++. They allow you to make decisions based on certain conditions and execute different sets of instructions based on those conditions. In this lesson, we covered the basics of conditional statements in C++ including if statements, if-else statements, if-else if statements, and the ternary operator. Now that you have learned the basics, you can use conditional statements to write more complex programs.
