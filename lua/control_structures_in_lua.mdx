# Module 2: Functions and Control Structures in Lua
## Lesson: Control Structures in Lua

Control structures are used to control the flow of a program. In Lua, there are three main types of control structures: conditional statements, loops, and function calls. In this lesson, we will cover the basics of these control structures in Lua.

### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to execute specific code blocks based on whether a certain condition is true or false. In Lua, the most common type of conditional statement is the `if-else` statement.

#### Syntax

```
if condition then
  --execute code if condition is true
else
  --execute code if condition is false
end
```

The `condition` in the `if` statement can be any expression that evaluates to a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

#### Example

```
age = 18

if age >= 18 then
    print("You are old enough to vote.")
else
    print("You are not old enough to vote.")
end
```

### Loops

Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a specific condition is met. In Lua, there are two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.

#### `for` Loops

`for` loops are used to iterate over a range of values.

#### Syntax

```
for start, finish, step do
  -- execute code in loop
end
```

The `start` variable specifies the starting value of the loop, `finish` specifies the ending value, and `step` specifies how much to increment the value on each iteration.

#### Example

```
for i = 1, 10, 2 do
  print(i)
end
```

Output:

```
1
3
5
7
9
```

#### `while` Loops

`while` loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

#### Syntax

```
while condition do
  -- execute code in loop
end
```

The `condition` in the `while` statement can be any expression that evaluates to a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

#### Example

```
num = 1

while num <= 10 do
  print(num)
  num = num + 1
end
```

Output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

### Function Calls

Functions are used to encapsulate code into reusable blocks. In Lua, functions can be declared and defined using the `function` keyword.

#### Syntax

```
function function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
  -- execute code in function
  return value
end
```

The `parameter1`, `parameter2`, etc. are optional parameters that can be passed into the function. The `return` statement can be used to return a value from the function.

#### Example

```
function add(a, b)
  return a + b
end

print(add(1, 2)) -- Output: 3
```

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we covered the basics of control structures in Lua, including conditional statements, loops, and function calls. These control structures are fundamental to programming and are used in many different programming languages. By mastering these concepts in Lua, you will have a solid foundation for learning other programming languages.
