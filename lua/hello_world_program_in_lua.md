# Module 1: Introduction to Lua Scripting
## Lesson: Hello World Program in Lua

### Introduction
Lua is a lightweight scripting language that is used for various purposes such as game development, web development, and embedded systems. The language is highly versatile and is known for its simplicity, speed, and flexibility.

In this lesson, we will look at how to create a simple "Hello World" program in Lua. This program is a traditional one, that is used to print a message on the screen or console.

### Prerequisites
Before you can start with this lesson, ensure that you have the Lua environment installed on your computer. Lua can be downloaded for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. You can find the download links and the installation instructions on the official Lua website, https://www.lua.org/.

### Creating a "Hello World" Program in Lua
To create a "Hello World" program in Lua, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment). You can use any editor or IDE that supports Lua programming.

2. Create a new file with the `.lua` extension. This file will contain the Lua code. For instance, if you are using Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code, you can create a new file by clicking on "File > New".

3. In the new file, type the following line of code to print the message "Hello World!" on the console:

```lua
print("Hello World!")
```

4. Save the file with any name you want. Ensure that the file has the `.lua` extension.

5. To run the program, open the console window (if you are using an IDE) or the terminal window (if you are using a text editor). Navigate to the directory where the file is located and type the following command to execute the program:

```lua
lua <filename>.lua
```

In the above command, replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you saved earlier.

If you followed the above steps correctly, you should see the message "Hello World!" printed on the console.

### Conclusion
In this lesson, we have seen how to create a simple "Hello World" program in Lua. This program is useful for learning the basics of Lua programming language, and to test the installation of Lua environment on your computer.

We hope this lesson has been helpful to you. We encourage you to explore more in the Lua programming language by experimenting with different programs and features.
