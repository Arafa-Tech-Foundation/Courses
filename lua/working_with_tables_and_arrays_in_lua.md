# Module 3: Tables and Modules in Lua
## Lesson: Working with Tables and Arrays in Lua

In Lua, tables are the most important data structures as they are used to implement associative arrays, classes, objects, and modules. Tables are collectible, which means that Lua can automatically free the memory when tables are no longer needed. Tables in Lua are dynamically resized and can be of any size, not necessarily contiguous memory blocks.

### Creating Tables
To create a table, we use the brace `{}` syntax or the `table` library functions. Here are some examples of creating tables in Lua:
```lua
-- Example 1: Creating a table using brace syntax
myTable = {}
myTable[1] = "apple"
myTable[2] = "orange"
myTable[3] = "banana"
myTable[4] = "grape"

-- Example 2: Creating a table using table library functions
myTable = table.concat({"apple", "orange", "banana", "grape"}, ",")
```
In Example 1, we create an empty table `myTable` and then add four elements to it by using the index notation. In Example 2, we use the `table.concat` function to create a table with four elements directly.

### Accessing Table Elements

We can access the elements of a table using the index or key. Here are some examples:
```lua
myTable = {}
myTable[1] = "apple"
myTable[2] = "orange"
myTable[3] = "banana"
myTable[4] = "grape"

-- Accessing elements by index
print(myTable[1]) -- "apple"
print(myTable[2]) -- "orange"
print(myTable[3]) -- "banana"
print(myTable[4]) -- "grape"

-- Accessing elements by key
person = {}
person.firstName = "John"
person.lastName = "Doe"
person.age = 30

print(person.firstName) -- "John"
print(person.lastName) -- "Doe"
print(person.age) -- 30
```
In this example, we create two tables, one with indexed elements `myTable`, and one with keyed elements `person`. We access the elements of these tables using both the index notation and the key notation.

### Iterating Over Tables
To iterate over a table, we can use the `pairs` and `ipairs` functions. Here are some examples:
```lua
myTable = {}
myTable[1] = "apple"
myTable[2] = "orange"
myTable[3] = "banana"
myTable[4] = "grape"

-- Using ipairs to iterate over indexed elements
for i, value in ipairs(myTable) do
  print(i, value)
end

person = {}
person.firstName = "John"
person.lastName = "Doe"
person.age = 30

-- Using pairs to iterate over keyed elements
for key, value in pairs(person) do
  print(key, value)
end
```
In this example, we use `ipairs` to iterate over the indexed elements of `myTable` and `pairs` to iterate over the keyed elements of `person`.

### Multi-Dimensional Tables
Lua tables can be multidimensional, meaning that we can have tables within tables. Here is an example of creating and accessing a multi-dimensional table in Lua:
```lua
-- Creating a multi-dimensional table
myTable = {
  {"apple", "orange", "banana"},
  {"red", "yellow", "green"}
}

-- Accessing an element in a multi-dimensional table
print(myTable[1][2]) -- "orange"
```
In this example, we create a two-dimensional table `myTable` with two rows and three columns. We access the element in the second row and second column using the index notation.

### Conclusion
Tables are critical to Lua programming, and we've covered the basics of working with tables and arrays in Lua, which is fundamental to the language. Once you understand tables and arrays in Lua, you can begin to build more powerful and efficient programs in Lua.
