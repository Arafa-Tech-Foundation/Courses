# Module 1: Introduction to Lua Scripting

## Lesson: Setting Up Lua on Your Computer

Lua is a lightweight and powerful language that is used to create a variety of applications, including games, mobile apps, and web servers. Before we start learning how to use Lua, we need to set it up on our computer. In this lesson, we will walk through the steps of installing Lua on Windows and macOS.

### Windows

#### Step 1: Download Lua

The first step is to download the Lua software from the official website. Go to https://www.lua.org/download.html and click on the link for the latest stable release. We recommend using version 5.3, which is the most recent stable release.

#### Step 2: Install Lua

After downloading the Lua software, double-click on the installation file and follow the instructions to complete the installation process.

#### Step 3: Test Lua

To test that Lua is installed correctly, open a command prompt window and type in the following command:

```
lua -v
```

This should display the version of Lua that you have installed.

### macOS

#### Step 1: Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install software packages. If you don't already have Homebrew installed, follow the instructions on the official website: https://brew.sh/

#### Step 2: Install Lua

After installing Homebrew, open a terminal window and type in the following command to install Lua:

```
brew install lua
```

#### Step 3: Test Lua

To test that Lua is installed correctly, open a terminal window and type in the following command:

```
lua -v
```

This should display the version of Lua that you have installed.
