# Module 3: Tables and Modules in Lua
## Lesson: Working with Lua Modules and Packages

### Introduction
Lua is a powerful scripting language with a simple syntax that allows for easy integration with C and C++ programming languages. Lua modules are pre-written Lua code that can be included in your programs and packages. In this lesson, we will learn the basics of working with Lua modules and packages, including how to create, import, and export modules. 

### Lua Modules
A Lua module is a collection of functions, variables, and other resources that can be accessed and used in other Lua programs. Modules are typically used to extend the functionality of a program or organize code into reusable components. 

#### Creating a Module
To create a module, we first define a Lua table and define the module contents within it. This table will act as a namespace for the module's functions and variables. Here is an example of a simple module that defines a single function:

```
-- Define the module table
local myModule = {}

-- Define the module function
function myModule.myFunction()
    print("Hello, world!")
end

-- Return the module table
return myModule
```

In this example, we define a module table called `myModule`. We then define a single function within the module called `myFunction` that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. Finally, we return the module table so that it can be accessed and used in other programs.

#### Importing a Module
To use a module in another Lua program, we need to import it using the `require` function. The `require` function takes a single argument, which is the name of the module being imported. The name of the module is determined by the file name of the Lua script that defines it. For example, if we had saved the module code above in a file called `mymodule.lua`, we would import it in another program like this:

```
-- Import the module
local myModule = require("mymodule")

-- Call the module function
myModule.myFunction()
```

In this example, we use the `require` function to import the `mymodule` module. We then call the `myFunction` function within the module by using the `myModule` table as a namespace.

### Lua Packages
In addition to modules, Lua also supports packages, which are collections of related modules that can be used together. Packages are typically organized in a directory structure, with each directory representing a package and each file in the directory representing a module.

#### Creating a Package
To create a package, we first need to create a directory to hold the package modules. Each module within the package is defined as a Lua script file within this directory. For example, let's say we wanted to create a package to handle math operations. We could create a directory called `math` and define several modules within it:

```
-- math/add.lua
local function add(a, b)
    return a + b
end

return add


-- math/subtract.lua
local function subtract(a, b)
    return a - b
end

return subtract


-- math/multiply.lua
local function multiply(a, b)
    return a * b
end

return multiply
```

In this example, we define three modules within the `math` directory: `add.lua`, `subtract.lua`, and `multiply.lua`.

#### Importing a Package
To use a package in a Lua program, we can import the entire package or individual modules within the package. When importing a package, we use the `require` function and specify the name of the package directory. When importing a specific module within a package, we include the module file name as a suffix to the package name. For example:

```
-- Import the entire package
local math = require("math")

-- Use a module from the package
local add = require("math.add")

-- Call a function from the module
local result = add(2, 3)

print(result)
```

In this example, we import the entire `math` package and assign it to the `math` variable. We then import the `add` module separately and assign it to the `add` variable. Finally, we call the `add` function with the arguments `2` and `3` and print the result to the console.

### Conclusion
In this lesson, we learned the basics of working with Lua modules and packages, including how to create, import, and export them. By using modules and packages, we can organize our code into reusable components and extend the functionality of our Lua programs.
