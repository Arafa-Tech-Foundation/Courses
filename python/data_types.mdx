# Lesson: Data types (Strings, Integers, Floats, and Booleans)

In Python, data types represent the type of value stored in a variable. The four basic data types are: strings, integers, floats, and booleans. In this lesson, we'll explore each of these data types in more detail.

## Strings

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotation marks (either single or double). For example:

```python
greeting = "Hello, world!"
```

In this example, `greeting` is a variable of type string.

## String Operations

You can perform several operations on strings:

- Concatenation (using the `+` operator)
- Repetition (using the `*` operator)
- Indexing (to access a specific character in a string)
- Slicing (to extract a portion of a string)

## Integers

Integers are whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero) that do not include a decimal point. For example:

```python
age = 30
```

In this example, `age` is a variable of type integer.

## Integer Operations

You can perform several operations on integers:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulus (`%`)
- Exponentiation (`**`)

## Floats

Floats are numbers that include a decimal point. For example:

```python
pi = 3.14159
```

In this example, `pi` is a variable of type float.

## Float Operations

You can perform the same operations on floats as on integers.

## Booleans

Booleans represent either `True` or `False`. They are useful for representing binary values in logic and control structures. For example:

```python
is_raining = True
```

In this example, `is_raining` is a variable of type boolean.

## Boolean Operations

You can perform several operations on booleans:

- Negation (using the `not` keyword)
- Logical AND (using the `and` keyword)
- Logical OR (using the `or` keyword)

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we've explored the four basic data types in Python: strings, integers, floats, and booleans. Understanding these data types is essential for writing Python programs, as they are the building blocks of all programs.
