# Lesson: Loops (while/for)

Loops are used in Python to repeat a set of statements multiple times. There are two types of loops in Python: `while` loops and `for` loops.

## `while` Loops

A `while` loop is used to repeat a set of statements as long as a condition is true. The basic syntax of a `while` loop is as follows:

```python
while condition:
    # statements to be repeated while condition is true
```

Here, `condition` is a Boolean expression that determines whether the loop should continue or not. For example, to print the numbers from 1 to 5 using a `while` loop:

```python
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

This would output:

```bash
1
2
3
4
5
```

## For Loops

A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and perform a set of statements for each item in the sequence. The basic syntax of a `for` loop is as follows:

```python
for item in sequence:
    # statements to be repeated for each item
```

Here, `item` is a variable that represents each item in the `sequence`, and sequence is the sequence being iterated over. For example, to print each element of a list using a `for` loop:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

This would output:

```bash
1
2
3
4
5
```

## Loop Control Statements

Python provides several loop control statements that can be used to modify the behavior of loops:

- `break` - This statement is used to terminate the loop immediately. The control of the program flows to the statement immediately after the body of the loop.
- `continue` - This statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration.
- `pass` - This statement is a null operation. Nothing happens when it is executed. It is used as a placeholder.

For example, to print the numbers from 1 to 5, except 3, using a `for` loop:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)
```

This would output:

```bash
1
2

4
5
```

To print the numbers from 1 to 5, except 3, using a `while` loop:

```python
i = 1

while i <= 5:
  if i == 3:
    i += 1
    continue
  print(i)
  i += 1
```

This would output:

```bash
1
2
4
5
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned about `for` loops and `while` loops in Python, as well as loop control statements. Loops are an important programming concept that allow you to perform repetitive tasks with less code, and can be used in a variety of applications. Now that you have an understanding of loops, you can use them in your own Python programs to solve problems more efficiently.
