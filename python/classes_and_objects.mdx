# Module 7: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

## Lesson: Classes and Objects

In this lesson, you will learn about classes and objects in Python. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which can interact with one another to perform complex tasks.

## What is a Class?

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that objects of that class will have. Here is an example of a class definition in Python:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def start(self):
        print("The car is starting.")

    def stop(self):
        print("The car is stopping.")
```

In this example, `Car` is the name of the class. The `__init__()` method is a special method that initializes the attributes of the class when an object is created. The `start()` and `stop()` methods are other methods that the `Car` class has.

## What is an Object?

An object is an instance of a class. It has its own set of attributes and methods, and can interact with other objects of the same or different classes. Here is an example of creating an object of the `Car` class:

```python
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
```

In this example, `my_car` is an object of the `Car` class, with the attributes `make` set to `"Toyota"`, `model` set to `"Corolla"`, and `year` set to `2020`.

## Accessing Attributes and Methods of an Object

To access the attributes and methods of an object, you can use dot notation. Here is an example of accessing the `make` attribute of the `my_car` object:

```python
print(my_car.make)
```

Output:

```txt
Toyota
```

Here is an example of calling the `start()` method of the `my_car` object:

```python
my_car.start()
```

Output:

```txt
The car is starting.
```

## Modifying Attributes of an Object

You can modify the attributes of an object by assigning a new value to them. Here is an example of modifying the `make` attribute of the `my_car` object:

```python
my_car.make = "Honda"
print(my_car.make)
```

Output:

```txt
Honda
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned about classes and objects in Python. You learned how to define a class, create an object of a class, and access its attributes and methods. With these skills, you can use OOP to organize your code and create complex programs.
