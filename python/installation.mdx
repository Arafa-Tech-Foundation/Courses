## Installing a Text Editor

There are several text editors available for Python development, including Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. For this lesson, we will use Visual Studio Code.

- Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
- Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the prompts.
- Open Visual Studio Code and install the Python extension by clicking on the "Extensions" icon on the left-hand side of the window and searching for "Python".
- Click "Install" and wait for the installation to complete.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Python and a text editor. In the next lesson, we will write and run our first Python program.
