## Data Types and Variables
In this section, you will learn about Python's data types and how to work with variables.

## Data Types
Python has several built-in data types, including:

- Numbers: Python supports integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.
- Strings: A string is a sequence of characters.
- Lists: A list is a collection of items that can be of different types.
- Tuples: A tuple is similar to a list, but its values cannot be changed once they are assigned.
- Dictionaries: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.

### Variables
A variable is a named reference to a value. In Python, you do not need to specify the type of a variable. You can assign any value to a variable, and Python will determine its type automatically.

Here is an example:

```python
Copy code
# Assign a value to a variable
x = 42

# Print the value of the variable
print(x)
```

Output:

```
42
```

### Operators
Python supports several operators for working with data types and variables, including:

- Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, % (modulus), ** (exponentiation).
- Comparison operators: == (equal to), != (not equal to), < (less than), > (greater than), \<\= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to).
- Logical operators: and, or, not.

## Control Flow
In this section, you will learn how to use conditional statements and loops to control the flow of your program.

### Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow you to execute different code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false. The most common conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else.

Here is an example:

```py
# Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero
x = -5

if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")
```

Output:

```
Negative
```

### Loops
Loops allow you to repeat code blocks a certain number of times or until a condition is met. The most common loops in Python are for and while.

Here is an example:

```py
Copy code
# Print the numbers from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

Output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```
