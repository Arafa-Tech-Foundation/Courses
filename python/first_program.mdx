# Module 1: Introduction to Python

## Lesson: Your first Python program

In this lesson, we'll write and run our first Python program. By the end of this lesson, you'll understand the basic structure of a Python program and how to run it.
To get started, open your preferred text editor and create a new file. In this file, we'll write a simple "Hello, world!" program.

## Writing Your First Program

To get started, open your preferred text editor and create a new file. In this file, we'll write a simple "Hello, world!" program.

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

This program uses the `print()` function to display the message "Hello, world!" on the screen. The parentheses are used to enclose the message, and the quotes indicate that it is a string.

Save the file with a `.py` extension, such as `hello_world.py`. This will indicate to your computer that it should be interpreted as a Python program.

## Running Your Program

To run your program, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your program is saved. Then, type the following command:

```sh
python hello_world.py
```

This will tell Python to execute the program hello_world.py. You should see the message "Hello, world!" displayed in the terminal.

Congratulations, you've written and executed your first Python program!
