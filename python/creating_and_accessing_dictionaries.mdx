# Lesson: Creating and Accessing Dictionaries

In this lesson, you will learn how to create and access dictionaries in Python. Dictionaries are a collection of key-value pairs.

## Creating a Dictionary

To create a dictionary in Python, you can use curly braces `{}`. Here is an example of creating a dictionary with three key-value pairs:

```python
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2", "key3": "value3"}
```

You can also create an empty dictionary by using empty curly braces `{}`:

```python
my_dict = {}
```

## Accessing Values in a Dictionary

To access a value in a dictionary, you can use its key. Here is an example of accessing a value in a dictionary:

```python
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print(my_dict["age"])
```

Output:

```
30
```

## Modifying a Dictionary

You can modify a value in a dictionary by assigning a new value to its key. Here is an example of modifying the value for the key "age":

```python
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
my_dict["age"] = 31
print(my_dict)
```

Output:

```
{'name': 'John', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York'}
```

You can also add a new key-value pair to a dictionary by assigning a value to a new key:

```python
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
my_dict["country"] = "USA"
print(my_dict)
```

Output:

```
{'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'country': 'USA'}
```

## Looping Through a Dictionary

You can use a `for` loop to iterate over all the key-value pairs in a dictionary. Here is an example of looping through a dictionary and printing each key-value pair:

```python
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)
```

Output:

```
name John
age 30
city New York
```

## Checking if a Key is in a Dictionary

You can use the `in` keyword to check if a key is in a dictionary. Here is an example of checking if a key is in a dictionary:

```python
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
if "age" in my_dict:
    print("age is in the dictionary")
```

Output:

```
age is in the dictionary
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned how to create and access dictionaries in Python. You also learned how to modify a dictionary, loop through a dictionary, and check if a key is in a dictionary. With these skills, you can use dictionaries to store and manipulate key-value pairs in your Python programs.
