# Lesson: Creating and Accessing Lists

In this lesson, you will learn how to create and access lists in Python. Lists are a collection of values that can be of different data types.

## Creating a List

To create a list in Python, you can use square brackets `[]`. Here is an example of creating a list with three values:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
```

You can also create an empty list by using empty square brackets `[]`:

```python
my_list = []
```

## Accessing Values in a List

To access a value in a list, you can use its index. The index starts at 0 for the first value in the list. Here is an example of accessing the second value in a list:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list[1])
```

Output:

```txt
2
```

You can also access values from the end of the list using negative indexing. `-1` is the index for the last value in the list. Here is an example of accessing the last value in a list:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list[-1])
```

Output:

```txt
3
```

## Slicing a List

You can also access a range of values in a list by slicing it. To slice a list, you can specify the start and end indexes separated by a colon `:`. Here is an example of slicing a list to get the second and third values:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[1:3])
```

Output:

```txt
[2, 3]
```

## Modifying a List

You can modify a value in a list by assigning a new value to its index. Here is an example of modifying the second value in a list:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[1] = 4
print(my_list)
```

Output:

```txt
[1, 4, 3]
```

You can also add a new value to the end of a list using the `append()` method:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list)
```

Output:

```txt
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Looping Through a List

You can use a `for` loop to iterate over all the values in a list. Here is an example of looping through a list and printing each value:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
for value in my_list:
    print(value)
```

Output:

```txt
1
2
3
```

## Checking if a Value is in a List

You can use the `in` keyword to check if a value is in a list. Here is an example of checking if a value is in a list:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
if 2 in my_list:
    print("2 is in the list")
```

Output:

```txt
2 is in the list
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned how to create and access lists in Python. You also learned how to modify a list, loop through a list, and check if a value is in a list. With these skills, you can use lists to store and manipulate collections of values in your Python programs.
