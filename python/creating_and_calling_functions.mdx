# Module 3: Functions in Python

## Lesson: Creating and calling functions

Functions are a fundamental concept in programming. A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It allows you to break down your code into smaller, more manageable pieces and reduces code duplication.

## Creating a function

A function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. Any parameters that the function takes are specified within the parentheses.

```python
def my_function(param1, param2):
    # Function code goes here
    pass
```

The function code goes within the function body, which is indented under the function definition. The `pass` statement is a placeholder that does nothing, but is required in order to define an empty function.

## Calling a function

Once you've defined a function, you can call it from other parts of your code by using the function name and passing any required arguments within parentheses.

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(2, 3)
print(result) # Output: 5
```

In this example, we define a function `add_numbers` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`. It returns the sum of `a` and `b`. We then call the function with the arguments `2` and `3`, which returns `5`. We store the result in the `result` variable and print it to the console.

## Conclusion

Functions are a powerful tool for writing modular and reusable code. They allow you to break down your code into smaller, more manageable pieces and reduce code duplication. With this knowledge, you should be able to create your own functions and call them from other parts of your code.
