# Module 2: Basics of Python

## Lesson: Variables and Assignments

In Python, variables are used to store values. You can think of a variable as a box that holds a value. You can give the box a name so that you can refer to the value later in your code.

## Declaring Variables

To create a variable, you simply give it a name and assign a value to it using the equals sign (`=`). Here's an example:

```python
message = "Hello, world!"
```

In this example, we're creating a variable called `message` and assigning it the value of the string "Hello, world!".

## Naming Conventions

When choosing a name for a variable, there are a few rules you should follow:

- The name should be descriptive and give some indication of what the variable represents.
- The name should be lowercase.
- If the name consists of multiple words, you can separate them with underscores (`_`).

Here are some examples of good variable names:

```python
first_name = "John"
age = 42
is_student = True
```

## Assigning Values

You can change the value of a variable at any time by assigning a new value to it. For example:

```python
message = "Hello, world!"
print(message) # Output: "Hello, world!"

message = "Goodbye, world!"
print(message) # Output: "Goodbye, world!"
```

In this example, we're first assigning the value of "Hello, world!" to the `message` variable, and then later assigning the value of "Goodbye, world!" to the same variable.

## Multiple Assignments

You can assign values to multiple variables at the same time by separating the variable names and values with commas. For example:

```python
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
```

In this example, we're creating three variables (`x`, `y`, and `z`) and assigning them the values of 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

## Swapping Values

You can swap the values of two variables by using a temporary variable. For example:

```python
x = 1
y = 2

temp = x
x = y
y = temp

print(x) # Output: 2
print(y) # Output: 1
```

In this example, we're swapping the values of `x` and `y` by using a temporary variable called `temp`.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned how to declare variables, choose good variable names, assign values to variables, assign values to multiple variables at once, and swap the values of two variables.
