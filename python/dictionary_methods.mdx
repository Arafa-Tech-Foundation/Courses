# Module 4: Lists and Dictionaries in Python

## Lesson: Dictionary Methods (keys, values, items, etc.)

In this lesson, you will learn how to use various dictionary methods in Python. Dictionaries are a collection of key-value pairs that can be used to store and retrieve data efficiently.

## Creating a Dictionary

To create a dictionary in Python, you can use curly braces `{}` or the `dict()` constructor. Here is an example of creating a dictionary:

```python
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
```

You can also create an empty dictionary by using empty curly braces `{}`:

```python
my_dict = {}
```

## Accessing Values in a Dictionary

To access a value in a dictionary, you can use its key. Here is an example of accessing the value associated with a key in a dictionary:

```python
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
print(my_dict["key1"])
```

Output:

```txt
value1
```

## Dictionary Methods

### keys()

The `keys()` method returns a list of all the keys in a dictionary. Here is an example of using the `keys()` method:

```python
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
print(my_dict.keys())
```

Output:

```txt
dict_keys(['key1', 'key2'])
```

### values()

The `values()` method returns a list of all the values in a dictionary. Here is an example of using the `values()` method:

```python
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
print(my_dict.values())
```

Output:

```txt
dict_values(['value1', 'value2'])
```

### items()

The `items()` method returns a list of all the key-value pairs in a dictionary as tuples. Here is an example of using the `items()` method:

```python
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
print(my_dict.items())
```

Output:

```txt
dict_items([('key1', 'value1'), ('key2', 'value2')])
```

### get()

The `get()` method returns the value associated with a key in a dictionary. If the key is not found, it returns a default value (which is `None` by default). Here is an example of using the `get()` method:

```python
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
print(my_dict.get("key1"))
print(my_dict.get("key3"))
print(my_dict.get("key3", "default_value"))
```

Output:

```txt
value1
None
default_value
```

## Modifying a Dictionary

You can modify a value in a dictionary by assigning a new value to its key. Here is an example of modifying a value in a dictionary:

```python
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
my_dict["key1"] = "new_value1"
print(my_dict)
```

Output:

```txt
{'key1': 'new_value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
```

You can also add a new key-value pair to a dictionary by using the `update()` method:

```python
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
my_dict.update({"key3": "value3"})
print(my_dict)
```

Output:

```txt
{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2', 'key3':'value3'}
```

## Removing Items from a Dictionary

You can remove a key-value pair from a dictionary by using the del keyword followed by the key. Here is an example of removing a key-value pair from a dictionary:

```python
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
del my_dict["key1"]
print(my_dict)
```

Output:

```txt
{'key2': 'value2'}
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned how to use various dictionary methods in Python. You can use the `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()` methods to retrieve information about a dictionary, and you can use the `get()`, `update()`, and `pop()` methods to modify a dictionary. You also learned how to create and access dictionaries, as well as remove items from them. With this knowledge, you can efficiently store and retrieve data in your Python programs.
