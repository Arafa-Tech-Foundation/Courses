# Lesson: Conditional statements (if/else)

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false. In Python, conditional statements are created using the `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords.

## `if` statement

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true. Here's the basic syntax:

```python
if condition:
# code to execute if condition is true
```

The condition is an expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`. If the condition is true, the code block indented below the `if` statement will be executed. If the condition is false, the code block will be skipped.

Here's an example:

```python
age = 25

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
```

This code will output `You are an adult` because the condition `age >= 18` is true.

## `else` statement

The `else` statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition in the `if` statement is false. Here's the syntax:

```python
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is true
else:
    # code to execute if condition is false
```

Here's an example:

```python
age = 15

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are not an adult")
```

This code will output `You are not an adult` because the condition `age >= 18` is false.

## `elif` statement

The `elif` statement allows you to check multiple conditions. `If` the condition in the if statement is false, it will check the condition in the `elif` statement. If that condition is also false, it will check the next `elif` statement, and so on. Here's the syntax:

```python
if condition1:
    # code to execute if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    # code to execute if condition2 is true
else:
    # code to execute if all conditions are false
```

Here's an example:

```python
age = 10

if age < 0:
    print("Invalid age")
elif age < 18:
    print("You are a minor")
else:
    print("You are an adult")
```

This code will output `You are a minor` because the condition `age < 18` is true.

## Nested `if` statements

You can also nest `if` statements inside other `if` statements. Here's an example:

```python
age = 25
income = 50000

if age >= 18:
    if income >= 40000:
        print("You are eligible for a loan")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible for a loan")
else:
    print("You are not eligible for a loan")
```

This code will output `You are eligible for a loan` because both conditions (`age >= 18` and `income >= 40000`) are true.

## Exercise

1. Write a program that takes an input from the user and checks if it's a positive number. If it is, print `Positive number`. If it's zero or negative, print `Not a positive number`.

   ```python
   number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

   if number > 0:
     print("Positive number")
   else:
     print("Not a positive number")
   ```

2. Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and prints the larger number. If the numbers are equal, print `The numbers are equal`.

   ```python
   num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
   num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

   if num1 > num2:
     print(num1)
   elif num2 > num1:
     print(num2)
   else:
     print("The numbers are equal")
   ```

   In this program, we take two numbers as input from the user and compare them using the `if`, ``elif, and `else` statements. If`num1`is greater than`num2`, we print `num1`. If `num2`is greater than`num1`, we print `num2`. If they are equal, we print `The numbers are equal.`

3. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user and checks if it's longer than 10 characters. If it is, print `Long string`. If it's 10 characters or shorter, print `Short string`.

   ```python
   string = input("Enter a string: ")

   if len(string) > 10:
     print("Long string")
   else:
     print("Short string")
   ```

   In this program, we take a string as input from the user and use the `len` function to check its length. If the length is greater than 10, we print `Long string`. Otherwise, we print `Short string`.

## Conclusion

Conditional statements are a fundamental concept in programming, and understanding them is essential for writing useful programs. In this lesson, we covered the `if`, `else`, `elif`, and nested `if` statements in Python. We also provided several exercises to help you practice using these statements in your code. By mastering conditional statements, you'll be well on your way to becoming a proficient Python programmer!
