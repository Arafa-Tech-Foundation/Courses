# Lesson: Importing modules and packages

In Python, modules are used to group related functions, classes, and variables. Packages are a way of organizing related modules together. In this lesson, you will learn how to import modules and packages in Python.

## Importing a Module

To import a module in Python, you can use the `import` statement followed by the name of the module. Here is an example of importing the `math` module:

```python
import math

print(math.pi)
```

Output:

```
3.141592653589793
```

The `math` module provides various mathematical functions, and `math.pi` is a constant value representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

## Importing Specific Functions or Variables from a Module

You can also import specific functions or variables from a module using the `from` keyword. Here is an example of importing the `pi` constant from the `math` module:

```python
from math import pi

print(pi)
```

Output:

```
3.141592653589793
```

This is equivalent to `math.pi`, but you don't need to prefix it with the module name.

## Importing a Module with an Alias

You can import a module with an alias using the `as` keyword. Here is an example of importing the `math` module with an alias:

```python
import math as m

print(m.pi)
```

Output:

```
3.141592653589793
```

This allows you to use a shorter name for the module.

## Importing a Package

To import a package in Python, you can use the `import` statement followed by the name of the package. Here is an example of importing the `numpy` package:

```python
import numpy

print(numpy.array([1, 2, 3]))
```

Output:

```
[1 2 3]
```

The `numpy` package provides various functions and classes for numerical computing.

## Importing Specific Modules from a Package

You can import specific modules from a package using the `from` keyword followed by the package name and module name. Here is an example of importing the `array` module from the `numpy` package:

```python
from numpy import array

print(array([1, 2, 3]))
```

Output:

```
[1 2 3]
```

This is equivalent to `numpy.array([1, 2, 3])`, but you don't need to prefix it with the package name.

## Importing a Package with an Alias

You can import a package with an alias using the `as` keyword. Here is an example of importing the `numpy` package with an alias:

```python
import numpy as np

print(np.array([1, 2, 3]))
```

Output:

```
[1 2 3]
```

This allows you to use a shorter name for the package.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned how to import modules and packages in Python. You also learned how to import specific functions or variables, and how to use aliases for modules and packages. With these skills, you can use external modules and packages in your Python programs to add functionality and simplify your code.
