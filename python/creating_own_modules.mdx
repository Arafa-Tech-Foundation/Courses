# Module: Modules and Packages

## Lesson: Creating Your Own Modules

In this lesson, you will learn how to create your own Python modules. A module is a file that contains Python code, and can be imported and used in other Python programs.

## Creating a Module

To create a module in Python, you can simply create a new file with a `.py` extension, and put your Python code in it. Here is an example of a module that defines a function to calculate the area of a circle:

```python
# circle.py

import math

def area(radius):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2
```

This module imports the `math` module, which provides the value of pi, and defines a function called `area()` that takes the radius of a circle as a parameter and returns its area.

## Importing a Module

To use a module in another Python program, you can import it using the `import` statement. Here is an example of using the `circle` module in another Python program:

```python
import circle

radius = 2.5
print("Area of a circle with radius", radius, "is", circle.area(radius))
```

Output:
```
Area of a circle with radius 2.5 is 19.634954084936208
```

This program imports the `circle` module and uses its `area()` function to calculate the area of a circle with a radius of `2.5`.

## Importing Specific Functions from a Module

If you only need to use specific functions from a module, you can import them using the `from ... import` statement. Here is an example of importing the `area()` function from the `circle` module:

```python
from circle import area

radius = 2.5
print("Area of a circle with radius", radius, "is", area(radius))
```

Output:
```
Area of a circle with radius 2.5 is 19.634954084936208
```

## Importing a Module with a Different Name

If you want to import a module with a different name, you can use the `as` keyword to give it a different name. Here is an example of importing the `circle` module with the name `c`:

```python
import circle as c

radius = 2.5
print("Area of a circle with radius", radius, "is", c.area(radius))
```

Output:
```
Area of a circle with radius 2.5 is 19.634954084936208
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned how to create your own Python modules and import them into other Python programs. You also learned how to import specific functions from a module, and how to import a module with a different name. With these skills, you can organize your Python code into reusable modules that can be easily shared and reused in other programs.
