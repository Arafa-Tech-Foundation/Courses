# Module 2: Control Structures and Functions

## Lesson: For Loops

Welcome to the lesson on for loops! 

### Introduction
Loops are used to repeat and automate a process. The for loop is a type of loop that executes a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. 

### Syntax and Structure
The syntax for a for loop is as follows:

```python
for variable in iterable:
    # code block to be executed
```

The `variable` is assigned the first value of the `iterable`, and the code block is executed. The next value in the `iterable` is then assigned to the `variable`, and the code block is executed again. This process continues until there are no more values in the `iterable`.

### Example
Let's take a look at a simple example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
    print(x)
```

Output:
```python
apple
banana
cherry
```

In this example, we loop through the `fruits` list and print each element to the console.

### Range Function
The `range()` function is often used in for loops to generate a sequence of numbers:

```python
for x in range(0, 5):
    print(x)
```

Output:
```python
0
1
2
3
4
```

In this example, we loop through the sequence of numbers from 0 to 4 and print each number to the console.

### Nested Loops
For loops can also be nested within other loops. Here is an example:

```python
adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in adj:
    for y in fruits:
        print(x, y)
```

Output:
```python
red apple
red banana
red cherry
big apple
big banana
big cherry
tasty apple
tasty banana
tasty cherry
```

In this example, we loop through the `adj` list and for each adjective, we loop through the `fruits` list and print out each combination of adjective and fruit.

### Break and Continue Statements
The `break` statement can be used to stop a loop before it has completed all its iterations:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
    if x == "banana":
        break
    print(x)
```

Output:
```python
apple
```

In this example, the loop is stopped once the value of `x` is equal to `"banana"`.

The `continue` statement can be used to skip an iteration of the loop:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
    if x == "banana":
        continue
    print(x)
```

Output:
```python
apple
cherry
```

In this example, the value of `x` is skipped when it is equal to `"banana"`.

## Conclusion
In this lesson, we learned about for loops and how they are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a condition is met. We also learned how to use the `range()` function, nested loops, and break and continue statements. With this knowledge, you can now use for loops to automate and simplify repetitive tasks in your code.
