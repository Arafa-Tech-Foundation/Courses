## Lesson 1: Variables

In this lesson, we'll learn about variables in C# and how to use them to store and manipulate data.

### What is a Variable?

A variable is a named container that stores a value of a certain data type. In C#, we declare a variable using the following syntax:

```csharp
datatype variableName = value;
```

The datatype is the type of data that the variable can store, and it can be any of the built-in data types, such as int, float, string, or bool. The variableName is the name of the variable, and it can be any valid identifier that follows the naming conventions. The value is the initial value that we want to store in the variable.

### Examples of Variables

Let's take a look at some examples of variables in C#:

```csharp
int score = 100;
float gravity = 9.81f;
string playerName = "John";
bool isGameOver = false;
```

Here, we declare four variables: score, gravity, playerName, and isGameOver. The score variable is of type int and has an initial value of 100. The gravity variable is of type float and has an initial value of 9.81. The playerName variable is of type string and has an initial value of "John". The isGameOver variable is of type bool and has an initial value of false.

### Naming Conventions for Variables

When naming variables in C#, there are a few naming conventions that we should follow:

1. Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable.
2. Use camelCase for variable names, starting with a lowercase letter.
3. Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms unless they are commonly used.
4. Use a consistent naming style throughout your codebase.

### Changing the Value of a Variable

In C#, we can change the value of a variable by assigning a new value to it. Let's take a look at an example:

```csharp
int score = 100;
Console.WriteLine(score); // output: 100
score = 200;
Console.WriteLine(score); // output: 200
```

In this example, we declare a variable score with an initial value of 100. We then print the value of score to the console using the Console.WriteLine() method, which prints "100". We then assign a new value of 200 to the score variable, and print it again using Console.WriteLine(), which prints "200".

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about variables in C# and how to use them to store and manipulate data. We learned how to declare variables, assign initial values to them, and change their values. We also learned about naming conventions for variables, and how to follow them to write clean, readable code.
