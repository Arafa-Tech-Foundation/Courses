# Module 5: Asynchronous Programming and Exception Handling

## Lesson 1: Debugging Techniques

Welcome to the first lesson of Module 5! In this lesson, we'll learn about debugging techniques in Node.js. Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in code. It's an essential skill for any developer. 

### Logging

One of the most common techniques for debugging is logging. Logging involves adding console.log statements to your code to output information about what your code is doing. This information can help you track down errors in your code. 

Here's an example:

```javascript
function add(x, y) {
    console.log(`Adding ${x} and ${y}`);
    return x + y;
}

const result = add(5, 10);
console.log(`Result is ${result}`);
```

In this example, we use console.log to output information about what our code is doing. We print out the values of x and y before adding them together, and we print out the value of the result after the addition.

### Breakpoints

Another powerful technique for debugging is using breakpoints. A breakpoint is a point in your code where the execution of your code will stop, so you can inspect the state of your program. 

Here's an example:

```javascript
function add(x, y) {
    debugger;
    return x + y;
}

const result = add(5, 10);
console.log(`Result is ${result}`);
```

In this example, we use the debugger statement to set a breakpoint in our code. When the code is executed, it will stop at the breakpoint, and we can inspect the values of x and y.

### Stack Traces

A stack trace is a list of function calls that shows how your code got to the point where it encountered an error. Stack traces can be incredibly helpful for finding the source of an error in your code.

Here's an example of a stack trace:

```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
    at getLength (app.js:3:23)
    at app.js:6:21
    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
    at sumArray (app.js:5:11)
    at app.js:9:16
```

In this stack trace, we can see that the error occurred in a function called getLength, which was called from within a function called sumArray, which was called from within a function that doesn't have a name (that's what <anonymous> means).

### Using try/catch

Sometimes errors can occur that you didn't anticipate. In these cases, you can use try/catch blocks to handle the errors gracefully.

Here's an example:

```javascript
try {
    const result = someFunctionThatMightFail();
    console.log(`Result is ${result}`);
} catch (e) {
    console.log(`An error occurred: ${e}`);
}
```

In this example, we use a try/catch block to handle any errors that might occur in someFunctionThatMightFail. If an error does occur, the catch block will execute, and we can output the error message to the console.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about several debugging techniques in Node.js. We covered logging, breakpoints, stack traces, and using try/catch blocks. By using these techniques, you'll be able to find and fix errors in your code more quickly and effectively.
