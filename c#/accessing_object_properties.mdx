# Module 3: Arrays and Objects

## Lesson 1: Accessing Object Properties

Welcome to the first lesson of the Arrays and Objects module! In this lesson, we'll learn how to access properties of objects in JavaScript.

## Objects

In JavaScript, objects are a type of data that allow us to store and organize related data. Objects consist of key-value pairs, where the key is a string that identifies a specific property, and the value is any type of data (such as a string, number, array, or even another object).

Here's an example of creating an object:

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  hobbies: ["reading", "cooking", "hiking"],
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown",
    state: "CA"
  }
};
```

In this example, we create an object called `person` with four properties: `name`, `age`, `hobbies`, and `address`.

## Accessing Object Properties

To access the value of a property within an object, we use the dot notation (`objectName.propertyName`). Here's an example:

```javascript
console.log(person.name); // Output: John
```

We can also access nested properties within an object by chaining dot notation. Here's an example:

```javascript
console.log(person.address.city); // Output: Anytown
```

We can also access object properties using bracket notation (`objectName["propertyName"]`). Here's an example:

```javascript
console.log(person["age"]); // Output: 30
```

Using bracket notation also allows us to access properties dynamically, using variables. Here's an example:

```javascript
let propertyName = "hobbies";
console.log(person[propertyName]); // Output: ["reading", "cooking", "hiking"]
```

## Modifying Object Properties

To modify the value of a property within an object, we can simply reassign the value using either dot notation or bracket notation. Here's an example using dot notation:

```javascript
person.age = 32;
console.log(person.age); // Output: 32
```

Here's an example using bracket notation:

```javascript
person["name"] = "Jane";
console.log(person.name); // Output: Jane
```

## Adding Object Properties

To add a new property to an object, we can simply assign a value to a new key (using either dot notation or bracket notation). Here's an example using dot notation:

```javascript
person.job = "Teacher";
console.log(person.job); // Output: Teacher
```

Here's an example using bracket notation:

```javascript
person["salary"] = 50000;
console.log(person["salary"]); // Output: 50000
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned how to access properties of objects in JavaScript using dot notation and bracket notation. We also learned how to modify and add properties to objects. In the next lesson, we'll learn about arrays and how to access their values.
