# Module 6: Conclusion

## Lesson: Recap of the Course

Congratulations, you have made it to the conclusion module! In this lesson, we will recap what we've learned in this course.

### Variables and Data Types

We started the course by learning about variables and data types in programming. Variables are used to store information that can be used later in the program. In JavaScript, there are six primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol.

```javascript
// example of declaring a variable and assigning a value
let myString = "Hello World";
let myNumber = 42;
let myBoolean = true;
let myNull = null;
let myUndefined = undefined;
let mySymbol = Symbol();
```

### Control Flow

We then moved on to control flow statements such as if/else statements and loops. If/else statements are used to test a condition, and if the condition is true, execute one block of code, otherwise execute another. Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

```javascript
// example of if/else statement
if (myNumber < 50) {
  console.log("The number is less than 50");
} else {
  console.log("The number is greater than or equal to 50");
}

// example of for loop
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// example of while loop
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

### Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be called from different parts of a program. They can also take parameters, which allow the function to perform different actions depending on the input.

```javascript
// example of a function with no parameters
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

// example of a function with parameters
function multiply(num1, num2) {
  return num1 * num2;
}
```

### Arrays

Arrays are used to store collections of data, such as a list of numbers or strings. They are indexed by integers, starting with 0.

```javascript
// example of declaring an array
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// example of accessing an element in an array
console.log(myArray[0]); // 1

// example of adding an element to an array
myArray.push(6);
console.log(myArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### Objects

Objects are used to store collections of data, but they allow you to associate a name (key) with each value.

```javascript
// example of declaring an object
let myObject = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

// example of accessing a value in an object
console.log(myObject.name); // John

// example of adding a new key-value pair to an object
myObject.job = "Programmer";
console.log(myObject); // {name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York", job: "Programmer"}
```

### Conclusion

In this course, we covered the basics of programming with JavaScript. We learned about variables and data types, control flow statements, functions, arrays, and objects. These concepts are the foundation of all programming and are essential to building more complex applications.

Congratulations on completing this course! We hope you found it helpful and that you continue to learn and grow as a programmer. Good luck on your journey!
