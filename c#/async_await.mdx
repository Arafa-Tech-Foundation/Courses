# Module 5: Asynchronous Programming and Exception Handling

## Lesson: Async/Await

Welcome to the Async/Await lesson of the Asynchronous Programming and Exception Handling module! In this lesson, we'll learn about Async/Await and how to use it in JavaScript.

### Introduction to Async/Await

Async/Await is a way to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code. It makes working with asynchronous code easier to read and understand by allowing us to write code that looks like it is executed in sequence.

Async/Await is built on top of Promises and is part of ECMAScript 2017. To use Async/Await, you must enable support for ES2017 in your environment.

### Async Functions

Async functions are functions that return a Promise. They are defined using the async keyword before the function name. Inside an async function, you can use the await keyword to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved.

```javascript
async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}
```

In this example, we define an async function called getData that uses the fetch API to make a request to a JSON API. We then use the await keyword to retrieve the response and parse it as JSON. Finally, we log the data to the console.

### Error Handling with Async/Await

Async/Await also allows us to handle errors in a way that looks and behaves like synchronous code. We can use a try/catch block to wrap our async function.

```javascript
async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

In this example, we wrap our async function using a try/catch block to catch any errors that occur during the execution of the function.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about Async/Await and how it allows us to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code. We also learned how to handle errors when working with Async/Await using a try/catch block. With this knowledge, you should be able to use Async/Await to write cleaner and easier-to-understand asynchronous code.
