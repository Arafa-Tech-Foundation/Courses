# Module 1: Introduction to C#

## Lesson 1: What is C#?

Welcome to the first lesson of the Introduction to C# module! In this lesson, we'll learn what C# is and why it's a useful programming language to learn.

### What is C#?

C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft in the early 2000s. It is a versatile language used for many different kinds of software development, including web development, game development, and desktop applications. C# is a popular language that is used by many developers worldwide and is known for its stability, efficiency, and security.

### Features of C#

C# has several features that make it a popular choice for developers:

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** C# is an object-oriented programming language, which makes it easy to write complex programs by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable objects.
- **Cross-Platform Development:** C# is a cross-platform language, which means that it can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Garbage Collection:** C# has built-in garbage collection, which automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, making it easier for developers to write code without worrying about low-level details.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** C# has excellent support for asynchronous programming, which allows programs to run efficiently and respond quickly to user input.
- **LINQ:** C# includes Language-Integrated Query (LINQ), which is a powerful tool for working with collections of data.

### Example Code

Here's an example of how to use C# to print "Hello world!" to the console:

```csharp
using System;

class HelloWorld 
{
    static void Main() 
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

In this code, we use the `using` keyword to include the `System` namespace, which contains useful classes for input and output. We create a class called `HelloWorld` with a `static` method called `Main`. Finally, we use the `Console.WriteLine` method to print "Hello world!" to the console.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned what C# is and why it's a popular programming language. We covered some of the key features of C#, including its support for object-oriented programming, cross-platform development, and asynchronous programming. We wrapped up the lesson with an example of how to use C# to print "Hello world!" to the console. Congratulations on completing your first lesson in the Introduction to C# module!
