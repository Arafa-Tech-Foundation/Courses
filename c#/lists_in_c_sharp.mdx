# Module 3: Arrays and Objects

## Lesson 3: Lists in C#

Welcome to the third lesson in the Arrays and Objects module! In this lesson, we'll learn about lists in C# and how they can be used to store and manipulate collections of data.

## Lists in C#

A list is a data structure that can store an ordered collection of elements. In C#, lists are defined in the System.Collections.Generic namespace and are represented by the List<T> class. The type parameter T defines the type of elements that the list can store.

Here's an example of how to declare a list of integers in C#:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
```

## Adding Elements to a List

To add elements to a list, we can use the Add() method. The Add() method adds an element to the end of the list.

```csharp
numbers.Add(1);
numbers.Add(2);
numbers.Add(3);
```

We can also use the AddRange() method to add multiple elements to the end of the list.

```csharp
List<int> moreNumbers = new List<int>{4, 5, 6};
numbers.AddRange(moreNumbers);
```

## Accessing Elements in a List

To access an element in a list, we can use the index operator []. The index operator takes a zero-based index as its parameter and returns the element at that position in the list.

```csharp
int firstNumber = numbers[0]; // returns 1
int secondNumber = numbers[1]; // returns 2
```

We can also use the Contains() method to check if an element exists in the list.

```csharp
bool isTwoInList = numbers.Contains(2); // returns true
```

## Removing Elements from a List

To remove an element from a list, we can use the Remove() method. The Remove() method takes an element as its parameter and removes the first occurrence of that element from the list.

```csharp
numbers.Remove(1); // removes the first occurrence of 1 from the list
```

We can also use the RemoveAt() method to remove an element at a specific index.

```csharp
numbers.RemoveAt(0); // removes the element at index 0 (which is 2)
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about lists in C# and how they can be used to store and manipulate collections of data. We covered how to declare a list, how to add and access elements in a list, and how to remove elements from a list. With these skills, you can now effectively use lists in your C# applications.
