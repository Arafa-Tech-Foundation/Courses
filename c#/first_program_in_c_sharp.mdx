# Module 1: Introduction to C#

## Lesson: First Program in C#

### Introduction

Welcome to your first lesson in Introduction to C#! In this lesson, we will be learning how to create and run our first program in C#.

### What is C#?

C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is used to create desktop applications, games, mobile applications, and more. C# is widely used by developers all around the world and is considered a powerful language for building applications.

### Setting up your Environment

Before we can create and run our first program in C#, we need to make sure that our environment has the necessary tools installed. The following are the steps to set up your C# environment:

1. Install Visual Studio: Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) used to develop applications. You can download and install Visual Studio from the official Microsoft website.

2. Create a new project: Once you have installed Visual Studio, open it and create a new project by selecting "File" > "New" > "Project". Select "Console Application" and click "Create".

3. Write your code: Visual Studio will automatically create a basic C# program for you. You can write your code in the "Program.cs" file.

### Writing your First Program

Let's write our first program in C#! Open the "Program.cs" file in Visual Studio and replace the existing code with the following:

```csharp
using System;

namespace MyFirstProgram
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

Here, we are using the "System" namespace, which contains the Console class that allows us to input and output data from the console window. We use the "Console.WriteLine" method to output the text "Hello World!" onto the console window.

### Running your Program

Now that we have written our first program, let's see how we can run it. We can use the F5 key to run our program in Visual Studio. Alternatively, we can build our program by selecting "Build" > "Build Solution" and then run it by selecting "Debug" > "Start Debugging".

Once we run our program, we should see the text "Hello World!" outputted onto the console window.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You have created and run your first program in C#. In this lesson, we learned what C# is, how to set up our environment, how to write our first program, and how to run it. In the next lesson, we will learn about variables and data types in C#.
