# Module 1: Introduction to C#

## Lesson 1: Setting Up Your Environment

Welcome to the Introduction to C# module! In this lesson, we'll go over how to set up your environment to start writing and running C# code.

### Installing Visual Studio

The first step in setting up your environment is to install Visual Studio. Visual Studio is a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) that is used to write and debug C# code. To download Visual Studio, go to the following URL: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/. 

On the downloads page, you will see several options for different versions of Visual Studio. We recommend downloading the latest version of Visual Studio Community (it's free!) for your operating system. The Community edition has all the features you need to get started with C# development.

### Creating Your First C# Project

Once you have installed Visual Studio, the next step is to create a new C# project. You can create a new project by doing the following:

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Go to File -> New -> Project.
3. In the New Project dialog box, select C# from the list of project types on the left.
4. Select Console Application from the list of templates.
5. Enter a name for your project and choose a location to save it.
6. Click Create.

Visual Studio will generate a new C# project for you with some starter code. You can start editing the code right away.

### Writing and Running Your First C# Program

Now that you have created a new C# project in Visual Studio, it's time to write and run your first C# program.

In the starter code generated by Visual Studio, you should see a Main method with some code inside it. This code will be executed when you run your program. You can write your own code inside the Main method to do whatever you want.

Here's an example program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console:

```csharp
using System;

namespace MyFirstCSharpProject
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
        }
    }
}
```

To run your program, click the green arrow button (or go to Debug -> Start Debugging) in the toolbar at the top of the Visual Studio window. Visual Studio will build your project and start running your program. You should see "Hello, world!" printed to the console.

### Debugging Your C# Program

One of the most important features of Visual Studio is its debugger. The debugger allows you to step through your code line by line, set breakpoints to stop execution at specific points, inspect variable values, and more.

To use the debugger, simply click the red dot button in the toolbar (or go to Debug -> Start Debugging). Visual Studio will build your project and start running your program. If you set any breakpoints in your code, the debugger will stop execution at the breakpoint so you can inspect the state of your program at that point.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned how to set up your environment for C# development. We covered how to install Visual Studio, create a new C# project, write and run your first C# program, and use the debugger to debug your program. Now that you have your environment set up, you're ready to start learning more about C# programming!
