# Module 4: Encapsulation and Inheritance

## Lesson 2: Inheritance

Welcome to the second lesson in the Encapsulation and Inheritance module! In this lesson, we'll learn about inheritance and how it is used in object-oriented programming.

### What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows one class (the child class or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (the parent class or superclass). Essentially, the child class is a more specific version of the parent class, and the child class inherits all of the properties and methods of the parent class.

### Using Inheritance

To use inheritance in your code, you first need to define a parent class with properties and methods that you want to be inherited. Here's an example of a parent class:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species

    def speak(self):
        print("Generic animal sound")
```

In this example, we have a parent class called Animal, which has an __init__ method that takes a name and a species as arguments and initializes instance variables with those values. The Animal class also has a speak method that prints a generic animal sound.

To create a child class that inherits from the parent class, we use the syntax `class ChildClass(ParentClass):`. Here's an example of a child class called Dog that inherits from the Animal parent class:

```python
class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name, "Canine")
        self.breed = breed

    def speak(self):
        print("Woof!")
```

In this example, we've defined a child class called Dog that inherits from the Animal parent class. The Dog class adds an instance variable called breed, and overrides the speak method to print "Woof!" instead of the generic animal sound.

### Overriding Methods

One important feature of inheritance is that child classes can override methods of the parent class. When a child class has a method with the same name as a method in the parent class, the child class's method is used instead of the parent class's method.

Here's an example of a child class called Cat that overrides the speak method of the Animal parent class:

```python
class Cat(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name, "Feline")
        self.breed = breed

    def speak(self):
        print("Meow!")
```

In this example, the Cat child class overrides the speak method of the Animal parent class to print "Meow!" instead of the generic animal sound.

### Using Super()

When you're overriding a method in a child class, you may want to call the parent class's version of the method as well. To do this, you use the super() function. Here's an example of a child class called Labrador that overrides the speak method of the Dog parent class, but also calls the speak method of the Animal parent class using super():

```python
class Labrador(Dog):
    def speak(self):
        super().speak()
        print("Bark!")

lab = Labrador("Buddy", "Labrador Retriever")
lab.speak()  # output: "Woof!" and "Bark!"
```

In this example, the Labrador child class overrides the speak method of the Dog parent class, but first calls the speak method of the Animal parent class using super(). This allows the Labrador class to both print "Woof!" and "Bark!" when the speak method is called.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about inheritance and how it allows child classes to inherit properties and methods from a parent class. We also learned how child classes can override methods of the parent class, and how to use the super() function to call the parent class's version of a method. By using inheritance in your code, you can create more efficient and organized object-oriented programs.
