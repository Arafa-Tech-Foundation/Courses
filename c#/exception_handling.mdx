# Module 5: Asynchronous Programming and Exception Handling

## Lesson: Exception Handling

Welcome to the Exception Handling lesson of the Asynchronous Programming and Exception Handling module. In this lesson, we'll learn about managing errors and exceptions in JavaScript.

## Error Handling in JavaScript

Errors are an inevitable part of programming, but they can be managed with proper error handling. In JavaScript, we can use try/catch blocks to handle errors and throw statements to generate errors.

### Try/Catch Blocks

Try/catch blocks are used to execute a block of code and handle any errors that may occur during execution. Here's an example:

```javascript
try {
    // code to be executed
} catch(error) {
    // error handling code
}
```

The try block contains the code to be executed, and the catch block contains the error handling code. If an error occurs in the try block, it is caught and the error handling code in the catch block is executed.

Here's an example of a try/catch block in action:

```javascript
try {
    let num = 10;
    num.toUpperCase(); // this will throw an error
} catch(error) {
    console.log("An error occurred: " + error);
}
```

In this example, we attempt to call the toUpperCase() method on a number, which is not a valid operation. This will throw an error, which is caught by the catch block. The catch block logs the error message to the console.

### Throwing Exceptions

We can use the throw statement to generate an error or exception in our code. Here's an example:

```javascript
function divideByZero(num) {
    if (num === 0) {
        throw "Error: Can't divide by zero!";
    }
    
    return 10 / num;
}
```

In this example, we define a function that takes a number as an argument. If the argument is zero, we throw an error with the message "Error: Can't divide by zero!". Otherwise, we return the result of dividing 10 by the number.

### Error Object

In JavaScript, all errors are represented by an error object. This object contains information about the error, such as the error message and a stack trace.

Let's take a look at an example of using the error object:

```javascript
function divideByZero(num) {
    if (num === 0) {
        throw new Error("Can't divide by zero!");
    }
    
    return 10 / num;
}
```

In this example, we define a function that throws a new instance of the Error object with the message "Can't divide by zero!". This allows us to access the error message and stack trace in the catch block.

### Final Thoughts

In this lesson, we learned about error handling in JavaScript using try/catch blocks and throwing exceptions. We also learned about the Error object and how to access error information. With proper error handling, we can write more robust and reliable code.
