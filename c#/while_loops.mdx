Module 2: Control Structures and Functions

## Lesson: While Loops

Welcome to the second lesson of the Control Structures and Functions module! In this lesson, we will learn about while loops and how they are used in programming.

## What are while loops?

A while loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat a block of code while a certain condition is true. The syntax for a while loop in JavaScript is shown below:

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

The condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the code in the block is executed, and the loop continues to the beginning to check the condition again. If the condition is false, the loop ends, and control continues with the code after the loop.

## Example: Printing numbers with while loop

Let's take a look at an example that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop.

```javascript
let i = 1;

while (i <= 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

In this example, we declare a variable `i` and initialize it to 1. The while loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to 5. In each iteration of the loop, we print the value of `i` and increment it by 1. The loop ends when `i` becomes 6, and the code execution continues with the next statement.

## Tips for using while loops

Here are some tips for using while loops:

- Make sure the condition will eventually be false so that the loop does not run indefinitely.
- Make sure you change the variable to be checked in the condition inside the while loop block.
- Avoid infinite looping by including a condition that will stop the loop.


## Example: Checking input with while loop

Let's take a look at another example that uses a while loop to check input from a user.

```javascript
let userInput = "";

while (userInput !== "quit") {
  userInput = prompt("Please enter a string (or type 'quit' to exit):");
  console.log("You entered: " + userInput);
}
```

In this example, we initialize the `userInput` variable to an empty string. The while loop runs as long as `userInput` is not equal to the string "quit". In each iteration of the loop, we prompt the user to enter a string, and store the result in the `userInput` variable. We then print a message indicating the user input. The loop ends when the user enters the string "quit", and control continues with the code after the loop.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about while loops and their syntax. We also looked at some examples of using while loops to repeat code while a certain condition is true. Remember to be careful when using while loops to avoid infinite looping, and make sure the condition is able to become false at some point to stop the loop.
