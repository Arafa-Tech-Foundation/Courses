# Module 1: Introduction to Node.js

## Lesson 2: Setting up Node.js on your computer

Welcome to the second lesson of the Introduction to Node.js course! In this lesson, we'll learn how to set up Node.js on your computer.

### Installing Node.js

To get started with Node.js, you'll first need to install it on your computer. You can download the installer for your operating system from the official Node.js website: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Once you've downloaded the installer, simply run it and follow the prompts to install Node.js on your computer.

### Checking the Installation

To check if Node.js is properly installed on your computer, you can open a command prompt or terminal and type in the following command:

```sh
node -v
```

This command will display the version of Node.js that is installed on your computer.

### Creating a Node.js Project

Now that Node.js is installed on your computer, you can create a new Node.js project. To create a new Node.js project, you'll need to create a new directory and initialize it as a Node.js project using the `npm init` command.

To create a new directory, open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create the new project. Then, type in the following command to create a new directory:

```sh
mkdir my-node-project
```

Next, navigate into the new directory and type in the following command to initialize the directory as a Node.js project:

```sh
npm init
```

This command will prompt you to enter some information about the project, such as the project name, version, and description. You can simply press enter to accept the default values for these prompts.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned how to set up Node.js on your computer, create a new Node.js project, and install packages in your project.
