# Module 2: Variables and Data Types in Node.js

## Lesson 1: Data Types in Node.js

Welcome to the first lesson of Module 2 on Variables and Data Types in Node.js! In this lesson, we'll learn about the different data types in Node.js and how to use them in our programs.

### Data Types in Node.js

Node.js supports several data types, including:

- **Strings**: Used for representing textual data. Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes.

- **Numbers**: Used for representing numeric data. Numbers can be integers or floating-point numbers.

- **Booleans**: Used for representing logical values. Booleans can have two values: true or false.

- **Undefined**: Used for representing the absence of a value. A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.

- **Null**: Used for representing the absence of a value. A variable can be explicitly assigned a null value.

- **Arrays**: Used for storing collections of data. Arrays are ordered lists of values, which can be of different data types.

- **Objects**: Used for representing complex data structures. Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be of any data type.

### Declaring Variables

Before we can use a variable in our program, we need to declare it. We can declare variables using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.

```javascript
// Declare a variable using var
var message = "Hello, world!";

// Declare a variable using let
let count = 0;

// Declare a constant variable using const
const PI = 3.14;
```

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about the different data types in Node.js and how to declare variables using the `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords.
