## Lesson 2: Declaring and Initializing Variables

Welcome to Lesson 2 of Module 2: Variables and Data Types in Node.js. In this lesson, we'll learn how to declare and initialize variables in Node.js.

### What are variables?

Variables are used to store values that can be changed throughout the program's execution. In Node.js, we use the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords to declare a variable.

### Declaring Variables

To declare a variable, we first need to specify the keyword followed by the variable name. Here is an example:

```javascript
var num;
let name;
const PI = 3.14;
```

In the above example, we declare three variables: `num`, `name`, and `PI`. The `var` keyword is used to declare `num`, while `let` is used to declare `name`, and `const` is used to declare `PI`.

### Initializing Variables

To initialize a variable, we assign a value to it. Here is an example:

```javascript
var num = 10;
let name = "John";
const PI = 3.14;
```

In the above example, we initialize `num` with the value of `10`, `name` with the string `"John"`, and `PI` with the value of `3.14`.

### Rules for Naming Variables

When naming variables, there are a few rules we need to follow:

- Variable names cannot start with a number
- Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Variable names are case sensitive
- Variable names should be descriptive

### Example

Let's look at an example of declaring and initializing variables:

```javascript
var num1 = 10;
var num2 = 20;
var sum = num1 + num2;

console.log(sum); // Output: 30
```

In the above example, we declare and initialize two variables `num1` and `num2` with the values of `10` and `20`, respectively. We then declare a third variable `sum` and assign it the value of `num1 + num2`. Finally, we log the value of `sum` to the console.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned how to declare and initialize variables in Node.js. We also discussed the rules for naming variables.
