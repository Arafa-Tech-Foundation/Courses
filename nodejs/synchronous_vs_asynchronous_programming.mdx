# Module 9: Asynchronous Programming in Node.js

## Lesson 1: Synchronous vs Asynchronous Programming

Welcome to the first lesson of Module 9: Asynchronous Programming in Node.js! In this lesson, we'll discuss the differences between synchronous and asynchronous programming and why asynchronous programming is crucial in Node.js.

### Synchronous Programming

Synchronous programming, also known as blocking programming, executes code sequentially, one line at a time. Each line of code must finish executing before the next line of code can execute.

Synchronous programming can be problematic in Node.js because it can cause the server to stop responding to other requests while waiting for one request to complete. This can lead to slow and inefficient performance, especially in applications that handle a large number of requests.

```javascript
// Synchronous function example
function synchronousFunction() {
  console.log("Step 1");
  console.log("Step 2");
  console.log("Step 3");
}

synchronousFunction();
```

### Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous programming, also known as non-blocking programming, executes code concurrently. Code does not need to wait for the previous line of code to complete before moving on to the next line.

Asynchronous programming in Node.js allows the server to handle multiple requests simultaneously, improving performance and scalability.

```javascript
// Asynchronous function example
function asynchronousFunction() {
  console.log("Step 1");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Step 2");
  }, 2000);
  console.log("Step 3");
}

asynchronousFunction();
```

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we discussed the differences between synchronous and asynchronous programming and how asynchronous programming is crucial in Node.js. Asynchronous programming allows the server to handle multiple requests simultaneously, improving performance and scalability.
