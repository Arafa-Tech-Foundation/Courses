# Module 3: Operators and Expressions in Node.js

## Lesson 2: Comparison operators

Welcome to the second lesson of the Operators and Expressions module! In this lesson, we'll learn about comparison operators and how they are used in Node.js.

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean value (true or false). The following comparison operators are available in Node.js:

- `==` (equal to): returns true if the two values are equal.
- `!=` (not equal to): returns true if the two values are not equal.
- `>` (greater than): returns true if the first value is greater than the second value.
- `<` (less than): returns true if the first value is less than the second value.
- `>=` (greater than or equal to): returns true if the first value is greater than or equal to the second value.
- `<=` (less than or equal to): returns true if the first value is less than or equal to the second value.

### Comparison Operator Examples

Let's take a look at some examples of comparison operators in action:

```javascript
const num1 = 10;
const num2 = 5;

console.log(num1 == num2); // false
console.log(num1 != num2); // true
console.log(num1 > num2); // true
console.log(num1 < num2); // false
console.log(num1 >= num2); // true
console.log(num1 <= num2); // false
```

In this example, we compare two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) using each of the comparison operators. The result of each comparison is then logged to the console.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about comparison operators in Node.js and how they are used to compare two values and return a boolean value. We covered the six comparison operators available in Node.js and looked at some examples of using them in code.
