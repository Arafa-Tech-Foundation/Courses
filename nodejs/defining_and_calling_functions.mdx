# Module 5: Functions in Node.js

## Lesson 1: Defining and calling functions

Welcome to the first lesson of Module 5: Functions in Node.js! In this lesson, we'll learn about defining and calling functions in Node.js.

### What are functions?

Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They can be used to avoid code duplication, increase code reusability, and improve code organization. Functions take input, called parameters, and return output, called return values.

### Defining functions

To define a function in Node.js, we use the `function` keyword followed by the function name, parameters (if any), and the function body enclosed in curly braces. Here's an example:

```javascript
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

In this example, we define a function called `sayHello` that takes one parameter called `name` and logs a greeting message to the console.

### Calling functions

To call a function in Node.js, we use the function name followed by parentheses and the arguments (if any) enclosed in parentheses. Here's an example:

```javascript
sayHello("John");
```

In this example, we call the `sayHello` function with the argument `'John'`.

### Function example

Let's look at a more practical example. Here's a function that calculates the area of a rectangle:

```javascript
function calculateArea(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}

const width = 5;
const height = 10;
const area = calculateArea(width, height);

console.log(`The area of the rectangle is ${area}`);
```

In this example, we define a function called `calculateArea` that takes two parameters, `width` and `height`, and returns the product of `width` and `height`. We then call the `calculateArea` function with the `width` and `height` variables and assign the result to the `area` variable. Finally, we log the result to the console.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about defining and calling functions in Node.js. Functions are essential building blocks in programming and can help make code more modular, reusable, and organized.
