## Lesson 2: Switch statements

Welcome to Lesson 2 of Module 4: Control Structures in Node.js. In this lesson, we'll be discussing Switch Statements, another conditional statement in JavaScript.

### Switch Statements

Switch statements allow you to compare a value against multiple options and execute code based on which option matches the value. The switch statement takes in a value and evaluates it against multiple cases. If a case matches the value, the corresponding code block is executed.

```javascript
switch(expression) {
  case option1:
    // Code block for option 1
    break;
  case option2:
    // Code block for option 2
    break;
  case option3:
    // Code block for option 3
    break;
  default:
    // Default code block
}
```

In the switch statement, the expression is the value being compared to the cases. Each case is a possible value that the expression may match. If none of the cases match, the code block in the default statement is executed.

### Example

Let's take a look at an example of a switch statement:

```javascript
let day = "Monday";

switch(day) {
  case "Monday":
    console.log("It's Monday!");
    break;
  case "Tuesday":
    console.log("It's Tuesday!");
    break;
  case "Wednesday":
    console.log("It's Wednesday!");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("It's not Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.");
}
```

In this example, we are using the switch statement to evaluate the value of the `day` variable. If the value matches one of the cases, the corresponding code block is executed. In this case, the value of `day` is "Monday", so the first case is executed, and "It's Monday!" is logged to the console.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we covered Switch Statements, which allow us to compare a value against multiple options and execute code based on which option matches the value. We also saw an example of how to use a switch statement in JavaScript. In the next lesson, we'll be discussing Loops in Node.js.
