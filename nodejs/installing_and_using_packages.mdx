# Module 8: NPM in Node.js

## Lesson 1: Installing and Using Packages

Welcome to the first lesson of Module 8: NPM in Node.js! In this lesson, we'll learn about NPM (Node Package Manager), how to install packages, and how to use them in our Node.js applications.

### What is NPM?

NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js that allows developers to install, share, and manage packages or modules of code. NPM is the largest package registry in the world, with over 1.5 million packages.

### Installing Packages with NPM

To install packages using NPM, we need to have Node.js and NPM installed on our computer. To check if Node.js and NPM are installed, we can run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

To install a package using NPM, we can run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
npm install package-name
```

For example, to install the Express package, we can run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
npm install express
```

### Using Packages in Node.js

After installing the package, we can use it in our Node.js application. To use the package, we need to require it in our code using the `require()` function.

For example, to use the Express package in our application, we can require it in our code as follows:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
```

Now, we can use the features and functionalities of the Express package in our application.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about NPM and how to install and use packages in our Node.js application. NPM is a powerful tool that makes it easy for developers to manage packages and improve their productivity.
