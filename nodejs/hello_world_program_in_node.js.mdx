# Module 1: Introduction to Node.js

## Lesson 3: Hello World program in Node.js

Welcome to Lesson 3 of the Introduction to Node.js course! In this lesson, we'll learn how to write a "Hello World" program in Node.js.

### Writing a "Hello World" Program

To write a "Hello World" program in Node.js, we need to create a new file with the `.js` extension and write the following code:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

This code uses the `console.log()` method to print the message "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Running a Node.js Program

To run a Node.js program, we need to navigate to the directory where the file is located and run the following command in the terminal:

```
node filename.js
```

Replace `filename` with the name of your file.

### Example

Let's create a new file called `helloworld.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Save the file and run the following command in the terminal:

```
node helloworld.js
```

You should see the following output in the terminal:

```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You've written and run your first Node.js program.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned how to write a "Hello World" program in Node.js and how to run it using the terminal. This is the first step in becoming familiar with Node.js and its capabilities. In the next lesson, we'll learn about declaring and initializing variables in Node.js.
