# Module 6: Arrays and Objects in Node.js

## Lesson 1: Creating and Accessing Arrays

Welcome to the first lesson of the Arrays and Objects in Node.js module! In this lesson, we'll learn how to create and access arrays in Node.js.

### What are Arrays?

Arrays are used to store a collection of data in a single variable. In Node.js, arrays are created using square brackets `[]` and can hold any data type, including other arrays.

### Creating an Array

To create an array, we use the following syntax:

```javascript
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

In this example, we created an array named `myArray` that contains five elements.

### Accessing Array Elements

We can access individual elements of an array using the index of the element. The index of the first element in an array is 0, and the last element's index is the length of the array minus one.

For example, to access the first element of `myArray`, we would use the following syntax:

```javascript
console.log(myArray[0]); // Output: 1
```

To access the last element of `myArray`, we would use the following syntax:

```javascript
console.log(myArray[myArray.length - 1]); // Output: 5
```

### Modifying Array Elements

We can modify the elements of an array by assigning a new value to a specific index. For example, to change the value of the second element in `myArray` to 10, we would use the following syntax:

```javascript
myArray[1] = 10;
console.log(myArray); // Output: [1, 10, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned how to create and access arrays in Node.js. Arrays are a fundamental data structure in programming, and they are used to store and manipulate collections of data.
