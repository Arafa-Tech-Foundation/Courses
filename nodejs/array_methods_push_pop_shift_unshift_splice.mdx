# Module 6: Arrays and Objects in Node.js

## Lesson 2: Array Methods (push, pop, shift, unshift, splice)

Welcome to Lesson 2 of Module 6! In this lesson, we'll learn about the different methods available for arrays in Node.js.

### Arrays in Node.js

An array is a collection of values or elements, represented by a single variable. In Node.js, arrays can be declared and initialized like so:

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

### Array Methods

There are several built-in methods available for arrays in Node.js that allow for manipulation and retrieval of data within the array.

#### push()

The `push()` method adds one or more elements to the end of an array. Let's take a look at an example:

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.push(6);
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

#### pop()

The `pop()` method removes the last element of an array. Here's an example:

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.pop();
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### shift()

The `shift()` method removes the first element of an array. Let's take a look:

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.shift();
console.log(numbers); // Output: [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

#### unshift()

The `unshift()` method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array. Here's an example:

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.unshift(0);
console.log(numbers); // Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

#### splice()

The `splice()` method allows for adding or removing elements from an array at a specified index. Let's see an example:

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.splice(2, 1); // Removes 1 element at index 2
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]
```

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we've learned about the different array methods available in Node.js, including `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, and `splice()`. These methods are essential for manipulation and retrieval of data within arrays.
