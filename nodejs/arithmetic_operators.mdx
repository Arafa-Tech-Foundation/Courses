# Module 3: Operators and Expressions in Node.js

## Lesson 1: Arithmetic Operators

Welcome to the first lesson of Module 3: Operators and Expressions in Node.js. In this lesson, we'll cover arithmetic operators and their use in JavaScript.

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on values. JavaScript has several arithmetic operators, including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), modulus (%), and exponentiation (\*\*).

Let's take a look at some examples of how these operators work in Node.js:

```javascript
// Addition
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 3;
let sum = num1 + num2; // sum equals 8
console.log(sum);

// Subtraction
let difference = num1 - num2; // difference equals 2
console.log(difference);

// Multiplication
let product = num1 * num2; // product equals 15
console.log(product);

// Division
let quotient = num1 / num2; // quotient equals 1.6666666666666667
console.log(quotient);

// Modulus
let remainder = num1 % num2; // remainder equals 2
console.log(remainder);

// Exponentiation
let power = num1 ** num2; // power equals 125
console.log(power);
```

### Order of Operations

When using multiple arithmetic operators in an expression, it's essential to consider the order of operations. The order of operations in JavaScript is similar to standard mathematical conventions, which is known as the PEMDAS rule: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

```javascript
let result = 5 + 3 * 2; // result equals 11
console.log(result);

result = (5 + 3) * 2; // result equals 16
console.log(result);
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about arithmetic operators and their use in JavaScript. Arithmetic operators are essential in performing mathematical operations on values in Node.js. It's essential to remember the order of operations when using multiple arithmetic operators in an expression.
