# Module 6: Arrays and Objects in Node.js

## Lesson 3: Creating and Accessing Objects

Welcome to Lesson 3 of Module 6! In this lesson, we'll learn about objects in Node.js, including how to create and access them.

### What are Objects?

In JavaScript, an object is a collection of properties that can be used to store and manipulate data. Objects can be created using object literals or the `Object()` constructor.

```javascript
// Creating an object using object literals
const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };

// Creating an object using the Object() constructor
const car = new Object();
car.make = "Toyota";
car.model = "Camry";
```

### Accessing Object Properties

Object properties can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation.

```javascript
// Accessing object properties using dot notation
console.log(person.name); // Output: John

// Accessing object properties using bracket notation
console.log(car["make"]); // Output: Toyota
```

### Object Methods

Objects in JavaScript can also have methods, which are functions that can be called on the object.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  greet: function () {
    console.log(
      `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`,
    );
  },
};

person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I'm 30 years old.
```

### Object Destructuring

Object destructuring is a convenient way to extract properties from an object and assign them to variables.

```javascript
const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };

const { name, age } = person;

console.log(name); // Output: John
console.log(age); // Output: 30
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about objects in Node.js, including how to create and access them, define object methods, and use object destructuring to extract object properties.
