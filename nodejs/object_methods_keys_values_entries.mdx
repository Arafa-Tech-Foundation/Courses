# Module 6: Arrays and Objects in Node.js

## Lesson 4: Object methods (keys, values, entries)

Welcome to the fourth lesson of Module 6! In this lesson, we'll learn about Object methods in Node.js, specifically `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()`. These methods are used to retrieve information about objects and their properties.

### Object.keys()

`Object.keys()` is a method that returns an array of a given object's own property names. It takes an object as an argument and returns an array containing the keys of that object.

Here's an example:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  gender: "male",
};

const keys = Object.keys(person);

console.log(keys); // Output: ['name', 'age', 'gender']
```

In the example above, we defined an object called `person` with three properties: `name`, `age`, and `gender`. We then used the `Object.keys()` method to retrieve an array of the object's property names and assigned it to the `keys` variable. Finally, we logged the `keys` array to the console.

### Object.values()

`Object.values()` is a method that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values. It takes an object as an argument and returns an array containing the values of that object.

Here's an example:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  gender: "male",
};

const values = Object.values(person);

console.log(values); // Output: ['John Doe', 30, 'male']
```

In the example above, we defined an object called `person` with three properties: `name`, `age`, and `gender`. We then used the `Object.values()` method to retrieve an array of the object's property values and assigned it to the `values` variable. Finally, we logged the `values` array to the console.

### Object.entries()

`Object.entries()` is a method that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property `[key, value]` pairs. It takes an object as an argument and returns an array containing arrays, where each inner array contains two items: the key and value of each property.

Here's an example:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  gender: "male",
};

const entries = Object.entries(person);

console.log(entries);
// Output: [['name', 'John Doe'], ['age', 30], ['gender', 'male']]
```

In the example above, we defined an object called `person` with three properties: `name`, `age`, and `gender`. We then used the `Object.entries()` method to retrieve an array of the object's property `[key, value]` pairs and assigned it to the `entries` variable. Finally, we logged the `entries` array to the console.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about Object methods in Node.js, specifically `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()`. These methods are used to retrieve information about objects and their properties. `Object.keys()` returns an array of an object's property names, `Object.values()` returns an array of an object's property values, and `Object.entries()` returns an array of an object's `[key, value]` pairs.
