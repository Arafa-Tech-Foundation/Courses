# Module 5: Functions in Node.js

## Lesson 2: Function parameters and return statements

Welcome to the second lesson of the Functions in Node.js module! In this lesson, we'll learn about function parameters and return statements, which are essential concepts in JavaScript programming.

### Function Parameters

Function parameters are variables that are passed into a function when it is called. They allow a function to receive input values and perform operations on them.

In JavaScript, functions can have any number of parameters, and they are separated by commas. Here's an example:

```javascript
function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

const sum = addNumbers(3, 5);
console.log(sum); // Output: 8
```

In the example above, the `addNumbers` function takes two parameters `num1` and `num2`, and it returns their sum. When the function is called with arguments `3` and `5`, it returns the sum `8`, which is stored in the `sum` variable.

### Return Statements

A return statement is used to return a value from a function. When a return statement is executed, the function stops executing, and the value is returned to the caller.

In JavaScript, functions can return any value, including strings, numbers, objects, and even other functions. Here's an example:

```javascript
function multiplyNumbers(num1, num2) {
  const product = num1 * num2;
  return product;
}

const result = multiplyNumbers(4, 6);
console.log(result); // Output: 24
```

In the example above, the `multiplyNumbers` function takes two parameters `num1` and `num2`, calculates their product, and returns the result using the return statement. When the function is called with arguments `4` and `6`, it returns the product `24`, which is stored in the `result` variable.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about function parameters and return statements in JavaScript. Function parameters allow us to pass input values into a function, and return statements allow us to return values from a function. These are essential concepts in JavaScript programming and are used extensively in web development. In the next lesson, we'll learn about creating and accessing arrays in Node.js.
