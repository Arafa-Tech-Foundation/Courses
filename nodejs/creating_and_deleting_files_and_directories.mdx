# Module 7: File System in Node.js

## Lesson 2: Creating and Deleting Files and Directories

Welcome to Lesson 2 of Module 7! In this lesson, we'll learn how to create and delete files and directories in Node.js using the built-in File System (fs) module.

### Creating Files

Creating a new file in Node.js is straightforward using the `fs.writeFile()` method. This method takes two arguments: the file name and the file content. Let's take a look at an example:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

fs.writeFile("example.txt", "This is an example file", (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("File created successfully");
});
```

In this example, we use the `writeFile()` method to create a new file named 'example.txt' and write the content 'This is an example file' to it. The third argument is a callback function that runs once the file is created. If there is an error creating the file, the callback function will throw an error.

### Reading Files

To read a file in Node.js, we can use the `fs.readFile()` method. This method takes two arguments: the file name and a callback function that receives the file content as an argument. Let's take a look at an example:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

fs.readFile("example.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```

In this example, we use the `readFile()` method to read the content of the 'example.txt' file. The second argument specifies the encoding of the file, which is set to 'utf8' in this case. The third argument is a callback function that receives an error and the file content as arguments. If there is an error reading the file, the callback function will throw an error.

### Deleting Files

Deleting a file in Node.js is also straightforward using the `fs.unlink()` method. This method takes the file name as an argument and deletes the file. Let's take a look at an example:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

fs.unlink("example.txt", (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("File deleted successfully");
});
```

In this example, we use the `unlink()` method to delete the 'example.txt' file. The second argument is a callback function that runs once the file is deleted. If there is an error deleting the file, the callback function will throw an error.

### Creating Directories

Creating a new directory in Node.js is also straightforward using the `fs.mkdir()` method. This method takes the directory name as an argument and creates a new directory. Let's take a look at an example:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

fs.mkdir("example", (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("Directory created successfully");
});
```

In this example, we use the `mkdir()` method to create a new directory named 'example'. The second argument is a callback function that runs once the directory is created. If there is an error creating the directory, the callback function will throw an error.

### Deleting Directories

Deleting a directory in Node.js can be done using the `fs.rmdir()` method. This method takes the directory name as an argument and deletes the directory. However, this method only works if the directory is empty. If the directory contains any files or subdirectories, we need to use the `fs.readdir()` method to read the contents of the directory and delete them before deleting the directory. Let's take a look at an
