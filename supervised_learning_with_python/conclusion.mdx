# Module 4: Optimization and Avoiding Overfitting

## Lesson Conclusion: Techniques for Avoiding Overfitting

In this module, we learned about the problem of overfitting and how to avoid it. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and captures the noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern.

## Regularization

One technique for avoiding overfitting is regularization. Regularization adds a penalty to the loss function of the model for model parameters that are too large. This encourages the model to use smaller parameter values, which can help to reduce overfitting.

### L2 Regularization

L2 regularization, also known as ridge regression, adds a penalty to the sum of squared model parameters. This can be written as:

```
L2 = lambda * (sum of squares of model parameters)
```

where `lambda` is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the penalty. L2 regularization encourages the model to use smaller parameter values, which can help to reduce overfitting.

### L1 Regularization

L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty to the sum of absolute values of model parameters. This can be written as:

```
L1 = lambda * (sum of absolute values of model parameters)
```

where `lambda` is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the penalty. L1 regularization encourages the model to use sparse parameter values, where many of the parameters are set to zero. This can be useful for feature selection, as it can identify which features are most important for the model.

## Early Stopping

Another technique for avoiding overfitting is early stopping. Early stopping involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during training. When the performance on the validation set stops improving, the training is stopped. This helps to prevent overfitting, as the model is stopped before it can become too complex.

## Dropout

Dropout is another technique for avoiding overfitting. Dropout randomly drops out (sets to zero) some of the neurons in the model during training. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any one neuron, which can help to reduce overfitting.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about three techniques for avoiding overfitting: regularization, early stopping, and dropout. These techniques can help to prevent overfitting by encouraging simpler models, stopping training before the model becomes too complex, and preventing the model from relying too heavily on any one neuron. Try using these techniques in your own models to improve their performance and prevent overfitting.
