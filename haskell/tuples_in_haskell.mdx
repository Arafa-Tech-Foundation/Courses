# Module 2: Data Types and Pattern Matching

## Lesson 4: Tuples in Haskell

Welcome to the Tuples in Haskell lesson of the Data Types and Pattern Matching module. In this lesson, we will explore tuples in Haskell, their syntax, and examples of using tuples.

### Introduction to Tuples

Tuples are a data type in Haskell that allow us to group different types of values together into a single unit. Tuples in Haskell are similar to tuples in other programming languages like Python or Swift.

A tuple is defined by enclosing a comma-separated list of values in parentheses. Here's an example of a tuple with two elements:

```haskell
(1, "hello")
```

### Tuple Syntax

The general syntax of a tuple in Haskell is as follows:

```haskell
(value1, value2, ..., valueN)
```

where value1, value2, ..., and valueN can be any value of any type.

### Accessing Tuple Elements

To access the elements of a tuple, we use pattern matching. Here's an example of a function that receives a tuple of integers as input and returns the sum of its elements:

```haskell
tupleSum :: (Integer, Integer) -> Integer
tupleSum (x, y) = x + y
```

Here, we match the tuple (x, y) to the input tuple and return the sum of its elements.

### Tuple Examples

Let's explore some examples of using tuples in Haskell:

```haskell
-- tuple of two strings
name :: (String, String)
name = ("John", "Doe")

-- tuple of a boolean and an integer
isEnabled :: (Bool, Integer)
isEnabled = (true, 1)

-- tuple of a string and a list of integers
person :: (String, [Integer])
person = ("John", [1, 2, 3])
```

Here, we declared three tuples with different types of values.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we have learned about tuples in Haskell, their syntax, how to access tuple elements using pattern matching, and explored examples of using tuples. Tuples are an important data type in Haskell, and knowing how to use them can help you write more concise and elegant code.
