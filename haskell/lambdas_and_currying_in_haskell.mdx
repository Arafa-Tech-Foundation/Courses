# Module 3: Higher-Order Functions and Recursion

## Lesson 4: Lambdas and Currying in Haskell

Welcome to lesson 4 of the Higher-Order Functions and Recursion module. In this lesson, we will be covering two important concepts in Haskell: lambdas and currying.

### Lambdas in Haskell

Lambdas, also known as anonymous functions, are functions that do not have a name. They are defined on the fly and typically used as arguments to higher-order functions.

Here is the general syntax for a lambda in Haskell:

```haskell
(\arg1 arg2 ... argn -> expression)
```

- The arguments are written in parentheses.
- The "->" separates the arguments from the expression.

Let's take a look at an example:

```haskell
addOne = (\x -> x+1)
```

Here, we have defined a lambda that takes one argument "x" and returns "x+1". We can use "addOne" like any other function in Haskell:

```haskell
main = do
    print(addOne 5) -- 6
```

### Currying in Haskell

Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each takes one argument. In Haskell, all functions are curried, meaning that we can partially apply a function by passing in only some of its arguments.

Here's an example of a curried function in Haskell:

```haskell
add a b = a + b
```

This function takes two arguments "a" and "b" and returns their sum. We can partially apply this function by only passing in the first argument:

```haskell
addTwo = add 2
```

Now, "addTwo" is a function that takes one argument "b" and returns "2 + b". We can use "addTwo" like any other function in Haskell:

```haskell
main = do
    print(addTwo 5) -- 7
```

### Combining Lambdas and Currying

Lambdas and currying are often used together in Haskell to create anonymous functions. Here's an example:

```haskell
main = do
    print((\a b c -> a * b + c) 2 3 4) -- 10
```

Here, we have defined a lambda that takes three arguments "a", "b", and "c" and returns "a * b + c". We have then applied this lambda to the values 2, 3, and 4.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we covered two fundamental concepts in Haskell: lambdas and currying. We learned how to define anonymous functions using lambdas and how to partially apply functions using currying. We also saw how these two concepts can be used together to create powerful and concise code in Haskell.
