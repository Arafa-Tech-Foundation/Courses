# Module 3: Higher-Order Functions and Recursion

## Lesson 3: Implementing Algorithms in Haskell

Welcome to the lesson on implementing algorithms in Haskell! In this lesson, we will learn how to implement algorithms using Haskell's higher-order functions and recursion.

### Higher-Order Functions

Haskell's higher-order functions allow us to pass functions as arguments to other functions, or even return functions as values. This powerful feature allows us to build complex algorithms using simple building blocks.

For example, let's say we want to sum the squares of a list of numbers. We can define a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument, and uses it to transform each element of the list before summing them:

```haskell
sumWith :: (Int -> Int) -> [Int] -> Int
sumWith f []     = 0
sumWith f (x:xs) = f x + sumWith f xs

square :: Int -> Int
square x = x * x

sumSquares :: [Int] -> Int
sumSquares xs = sumWith square xs
```

Here, we define a function `sumWith` that takes a function `f` and a list `xs`, and returns the sum of applying `f` to each element of `xs`. We then define a function `square` that squares its argument, and use it to define our final function `sumSquares`, which takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of their squares.

### Recursion

Recursion is a fundamental concept in Haskell. Almost every algorithm can be expressed recursively in some way. There are two main types of recursion: structural recursion and generative recursion.

Structural recursion involves recursively breaking a data structure down into smaller substructures until we reach a base case, at which point we can return a value. Here is an example of defining a function `sumList` recursively using structural recursion:

```haskell
sumList :: [Int] -> Int
sumList []     = 0
sumList (x:xs) = x + sumList xs
```

Here, we define a function `sumList` that recursively sums a list of integers. We specify our base case as an empty list, which has a sum of 0. We then use pattern matching to split the input list into its head `x` and tail `xs`, and recursively sum the tail by calling the `sumList` function.

Generative recursion involves constructing a sequence of values using a recursive formula or set of rules. A classic example of generative recursion is the Fibonacci sequence. Here is an example of defining a function `fibonacci` recursively using generative recursion:

```haskell
fibonacci :: Int -> Int
fibonacci 0 = 0
fibonacci 1 = 1
fibonacci n = fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2)
```

Here, we define the Fibonacci sequence recursively by specifying the first two terms `fibonacci 0` and `fibonacci 1`. We then use a recursive formula to generate the remaining terms.

### Implementing Common Algorithms

Using higher-order functions and recursion, we can implement a wide variety of common algorithms. Here are a few examples:

- Sorting: There are many sorting algorithms, but one of the simplest is the selection sort algorithm. Here is an example of defining a function `selectionSort` in Haskell:

```haskell
selectionSort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
selectionSort [] = []
selectionSort xs = let x = minimum xs
                       in x : selectionSort (delete x xs)
```

Here, we define a function `selectionSort` that sorts a list of comparable elements in ascending order. We use a recursive algorithm to repeatedly find the minimum element in the list and add it to our sorted list.

- Searching: Binary search is a simple and efficient algorithm for searching a sorted list. Here is an example of implementing binary search in Haskell:

```haskell
binarySearch :: Ord a => a -> [a] -> Bool
binarySearch x xs
    | length xs == 0 = False
    | x < mid        = binarySearch x (take (midIndex xs) xs)
    | x > mid        = binarySearch x (drop (midIndex xs) xs)
    | otherwise      = True
    where mid = xs !! (midIndex xs)

midIndex :: [a] -> Int
midIndex xs = length xs `div` 2
```

Here, we define a function `binarySearch` that searches a sorted list for a given element `x`. We use a recursive algorithm that divides the list in half at each step and searches the appropriate half, depending on whether `x` is greater or less than the midpoint.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned how to implement algorithms in Haskell using higher-order functions and recursion. We saw how higher-order functions allow us to build complex algorithms from simple building blocks, and how recursion is a fundamental concept in Haskell that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. By combining these two concepts, we can implement common algorithms such as sorting and searching with ease.
