# Module 3: Higher-Order Functions and Recursion

## Lesson 1: Higher Order Functions in Haskell

### What are Higher Order Functions?

In Haskell, functions can be treated just like any other value. Higher order functions are functions that take other functions as parameters, or return functions as their result. This allows for a great deal of flexibility and abstraction in programming.

### Why Use Higher Order Functions?

Higher order functions make code more modular and reusable, and can lead to more expressive and concise code. They allow you to write general-purpose functions that can be used in many contexts.

### Example Higher-Order Functions

Here are some examples of higher-order functions in Haskell:

#### Map function

The `map` function applies a function to each element in a list and returns a new list with the results.

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
```

The first parameter is a function that takes a value of type `a` and returns a value of type `b`. The second is a list of values of type `a`. The result is a new list of values of type `b`.

An example usage of the `map` function is:

```haskell
map (+2) [1,2,3]
```

The output of this code is `[3,4,5]`. This is because the `(+2)` function is applied to each element in the list, resulting in a new list of values that are 2 greater than the original ones.

#### Filter function

The `filter` function takes a function that returns a boolean value and a list, and returns a new list containing only the elements for which the function returns `True`.

```haskell
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
```

An example usage of the `filter` function is:

```haskell
filter even [1,2,3,4,5]
```

The output of this code is `[2,4]`, which contains only the even numbers from the original list.

### Creating Your Own Higher Order Functions

Creating your own higher order functions is a powerful way to abstract common patterns in your code. Here's an example of a higher order function that takes a list and a function, and applies the function to each element in the list:

```haskell
applyToAll :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
applyToAll f [] = []
applyToAll f (x:xs) = f x : applyToAll f xs
```

This function takes a function `f` that maps a type `a` to a type `b`, and a list of type `a`. It returns a new list of type `b` containing the result of applying `f` to each element in the original list.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about higher-order functions in Haskell. We saw some examples of built-in higher-order functions like `map` and `filter`, and we saw how to create our own higher-order functions. These tools can help us write more modular, expressive, and reusable code.
