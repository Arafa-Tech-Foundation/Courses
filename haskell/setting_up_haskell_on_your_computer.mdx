# Module 1: Introduction to Functional Programming

## Lesson 2: Setting Up Haskell on Your Computer

Welcome to Module 1 of the Introduction to Functional Programming course! Before we can dive into the world of Haskell, we first need to set up Haskell on our computers.

### Installation

Firstly, we need to install Haskell. The easiest way to do this is by downloading and running the Haskell Platform, which includes everything we need to get started. You can download it from the official website: https://www.haskell.org/platform/

Once you've downloaded the Haskell Platform, simply run the installer and follow the instructions.

### Writing our First Haskell Program

Once the installation is complete, we can open our favorite code editor and start writing Haskell code!

Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program.

Open up a new file in your code editor and type the following:

```haskell
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
```

Save this file with a .hs extension.

Now, we need to compile and run this program. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file and type the following command:

```bash
$ ghc hello.hs
```

This will compile the Haskell code into an executable file. Once the compilation is complete, we can run the program by typing the following command:

```bash
$ ./hello
```

You should see the output "Hello, World!" printed to the terminal.

### The Haskell Interpreter

Another way to run Haskell code is by using the Haskell interpreter, called GHCI.

Open up your terminal and type the following command to start GHCI:

```bash
$ ghci
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
GHCi, version 8.6.4: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude>
```

Now, we can type Haskell code directly into the interpreter and see the results instantly.

Let's try the "Hello, World!" program in GHCI:

```haskell
Prelude> putStrLn "Hello, World!"
```

You should see the output "Hello, World!" printed to the terminal.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned how to set up Haskell on our computers and write our first Haskell program. We also learned how to compile and run Haskell programs using GHC and the Haskell interpreter, GHCI.
