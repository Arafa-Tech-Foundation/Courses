# Module 2: Data Types and Pattern Matching

## Lesson 3: List Manipulation in Haskell

Welcome to the third lesson of the Data Types and Pattern Matching module! In this lesson, we'll learn about list manipulation in Haskell.

## Lists in Haskell

Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Haskell. A list is a sequence of elements of the same type, that can be manipulated using various operations.

In Haskell, lists are represented using square brackets and commas, with the elements separated by commas. For example, here is a list of integers:

```haskell
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## List Operations

There are several operations that can be performed on lists in Haskell.

### Length

The length function returns the length of a list, which is the number of elements in the list.

```haskell
len = length [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -- returns 5
```

### Concatenation

The ++ operator can be used to concatenate two lists together.

```haskell
numbers1 = [1, 2, 3]
numbers2 = [4, 5, 6]

concatenated = numbers1 ++ numbers2 -- returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### Indexing

The !! operator can be used to access the element at a specific index in a list.

```haskell
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

third = numbers !! 2 -- returns 3
```

### Slicing

The take and drop functions can be used to slice a list.

The take function takes the first n elements of a list.

```haskell
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

firstThree = take 3 numbers -- returns [1, 2, 3]
```

The drop function drops the first n elements of a list.

```haskell
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

withoutFirstThree = drop 3 numbers -- returns [4, 5]
```

### Mapping

The map function applies a function to each element in a list and returns a new list with the results.

```haskell
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

squared = map (\x -> x * x) numbers -- returns [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

### Filtering

The filter function takes a predicate function and a list, and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the predicate.

```haskell
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

evenNumbers = filter (\x -> x `mod` 2 == 0) numbers -- returns [2, 4]
```

### Folding

The foldr and foldl functions can be used to traverse a list and accumulate a result.

The foldr function takes a function with two arguments and an accumulator value, and applies the function to each element in the list, starting from the right end, and the accumulator value.

```haskell
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

sum = foldr (+) 0 numbers -- returns 15
```

The foldl function is similar to foldr, but it starts from the left end of the list.

```haskell
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

product = foldl (*) 1 numbers -- returns 120
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about list manipulation in Haskell. We covered several operations that can be performed on lists, such as length, concatenation, indexing, slicing, mapping, filtering, and folding. By using these operations, we can manipulate lists in a variety of ways and build more complex programs.
