# Module 4: Monads and IO Operations

## Lesson 3: The IO Monad in Haskell

Welcome to the IO Monad lesson in Haskell. In this lesson, we will learn about Haskell's IO Monad and how it is used in Haskell for performing input-output (IO) operations.

## The IO Monad

In Haskell, everything related to IO is wrapped in the IO Monad. The basic idea is that instead of performing IO operations directly, in Haskell, we construct a description of those operations, which we then execute by binding the IO Monad.

For example, let's say we want to perform a simple IO operation that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. In Haskell, we can construct the following Monad:

```haskell
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
```

Here, we construct the IO Monad that performs the putStrLn operation, which prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Understanding the IO Monad

The IO Monad works by describing a series of IO operations that need to be performed and returning a value that represents the result of those operations. In Haskell, the type of the IO Monad represents the type of the value that is returned.

To understand how this works, let's consider an example. Suppose we want to read a line from the console and then print that line back out. We can construct the following Monad:

```haskell
main = do
  line <- getLine
  putStrLn $ "You said: " ++ line
```

Here, we use the getLine operation to read a line from the console and bind it to the variable "line". We then construct a new string that concatenates the input with a message, and print it out using the putStrLn operation.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about Haskell's IO Monad and how it is used to perform IO operations. We learned how to construct simple IO operations such as printing output to the console and how to use IO operations such as getLine to read input from the console. We also learned about the basic structure of the IO Monad and how it works in Haskell.
