## Lesson 4: Using Monads for Error Handling in Haskell

In functional programming, errors are often handled using monads. In this lesson, we'll learn how to use monads for error handling in Haskell.

### The Maybe Monad

The Maybe monad is a basic monad that is often used for error handling in Haskell. The Maybe monad represents a computation that might succeed (return a value) or might fail (return Nothing).

Here's an example to demonstrate how to use the Maybe monad for error handling:

```haskell
safeHead :: [a] -> Maybe a
safeHead [] = Nothing
safeHead (x:_) = Just x
```

In this example, `safeHead` returns the first element of a list if it exists, and `Nothing` if the list is empty. The `Maybe` type is used to represent the possibility of failure.

### The Either Monad

The `Either` monad is another monad that is commonly used for error handling in Haskell. The `Either` monad represents a computation that may succeed (return a value of type `Right`) or may fail (return a value of type `Left`). The `Left` value is typically used to hold an error message.

Here's an example to demonstrate how to use the `Either` monad for error handling:

```haskell
divide :: Int -> Int -> Either String Int
divide _ 0 = Left "divide by zero"
divide x y = Right (x `div` y)
```

In this example, `divide` divides two numbers and returns either the quotient of the division or an error message if division by zero is attempted.

### Combining Monads

We can also combine different monads to handle different types of errors. For example, if we want to handle both division by zero errors and out of range errors, we could use the `Either` monad to represent both types of errors:

```haskell
divide :: Int -> Int -> Either String Int
divide _ 0 = Left "divide by zero"
divide x y | y < 1 || y > 10 = Left "out of range"
           | otherwise = Right (x `div` y)
```

Here, `divide` returns an error message if either division by zero or division by a number outside of the range `[1,10]` is attempted.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned how to use monads for error handling in Haskell. We explored the `Maybe` and `Either` monads and how they can be used for error handling. We also learned how to combine monads to handle different types of errors.
