## Lesson 2: Data Types and Variables

In this lesson, we will discuss data types and variables in C++. C++ is a strongly-typed language which means each variable must be declared with a specific data type. A variable is a storage location in memory which holds a value. In C++, we declare a variable with a data type and a name.

### Data Types

Data types specify the type of data that a variable can hold. You can declare variables of various data types such as int (integer), char (character), float (floating-point number), double (double-precision floating-point number) and so on. Here is a table of some commonly used data types in C++ along with the amount of memory each one takes up:

| Data Type | Description | Size (in bytes) |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------------|
| int       | integer     | 2 or 4         |
| char      | character   | 1              |
| float     | floating-point number | 4 |
| double    | double-precision floating-point number | 8 |
| bool      | boolean     | 1              |

### Variables

A variable is a named storage location in memory that holds a value. In C++, we can declare and initialize a variable in one statement:

```c++
int age = 20;
```

This statement declares a variable `age` of type `int` and sets its initial value to `20`. We can also declare a variable without initializing it:

```c++
int age;
```

This statement declares a variable `age` of type `int` but does not set its initial value. The value stored in an uninitialized variable is undefined.

### Variable Names

A variable name is an identifier that is used to refer to a variable in the program. A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore, and can contain letters, digits, and underscores. Variable names are case sensitive. Here are some examples of valid and invalid variable names:

```c++
int age;   // valid variable name: age
int 2a;    // invalid variable name: starts with a digit
int _age;  // valid variable name: _age
int @age;  // invalid variable name: contains a special character
```

### Type Conversion

C++ allows us to convert a value from one data type to another. This is called type conversion or typecasting. There are two types of type conversion: implicit and explicit.

Implicit type conversion is done by the compiler when it automatically converts a value to a different data type. This is also called coercion. For example:

```c++
int num = 5;
float fnum = num;   // implicit conversion from int to float
```

In this example, the integer value `5` is implicitly converted to a floating-point value `5.0` and stored in the variable `fnum`.

Explicit type conversion is done by the programmer using a cast operator. There are two types of cast operators: static_cast and dynamic_cast. The syntax for static_cast is:

```c++
static_cast<new_type>(expression)
```

Here is an example:

```c++
int num = 5;
float fnum = static_cast<float>(num);   // explicit conversion from int to float using static_cast
```

In this example, the value `5` is explicitly converted from an integer to a floating-point number using the static_cast operator.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we discussed data types and variables in C++. We learned how to declare and initialize variables, how to define variable names, and how to convert values from one data type to another. Data types and variables are fundamental concepts in C++ programming, and understanding them is essential for writing efficient and effective programs.
