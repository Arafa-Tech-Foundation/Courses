# Module 1: Getting Started with C++
## Lesson: Setting Up C++ on Your Computer

Welcome to the first lesson of Module 1: Getting Started with C++. In this lesson, we will be discussing how to set up C++ on your computer.

## What is C++?

C++ is a general-purpose programming language that is used for developing a wide range of applications, including system software, game engines, and desktop applications. Many popular programs and games are developed using C++, including Adobe Photoshop, Google Chrome, and Minecraft.

## Setting up C++ on Your Computer

To get started with C++, you first need to install a C++ compiler on your computer. A compiler is a program that can translate your source code into machine code that your computer can understand and execute.

There are several popular C++ compilers available, including:

- **Microsoft Visual C++**: Microsoft's flagship C++ compiler, widely used on Windows platforms.
- **gcc**: A Unix-based compiler available for many platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- **Clang**: Another Unix-based compiler used on Mac and Linux systems.

For this lesson, we will be using Microsoft Visual C++, which can be downloaded for free from the Microsoft website.

### Step 1: Download and Install Microsoft Visual C++

You can download Microsoft Visual C++ from the Microsoft website at https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/. Once you have downloaded the installer, run it to begin the installation process.

During the installation process, you will be asked to select the components you want to install. Make sure that the "Desktop development with C++" option is selected, as this includes the necessary tools for creating C++ applications.

Once the installation is complete, you should have access to the Visual Studio IDE, which is an integrated development environment that provides a graphical interface for creating, editing, and testing C++ programs.

### Step 2: Create a New C++ Project

To create a new C++ project in Visual Studio, select "File" -> "New" -> "Project" from the menu bar. In the "New Project" dialog box, select "Visual C++" -> "Windows Console Application". Give your project a name and click "Create".

Visual Studio will create a new C++ project, including a source file named "main.cpp". This is the file where you will write your C++ code.

### Step 3: Write and Run a C++ Program

To write a simple "Hello World" program in C++, replace the contents of "main.cpp" with the following code:

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

This code uses the `cout` object from the `iostream` library to print the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

To run the program, you can either click the "Start" button in the Visual Studio toolbar or press the F5 key. Visual Studio will compile your code and run the program in a console window.

Congratulations, you have successfully set up C++ on your computer and written your first C++ program!

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we discussed how to set up C++ on your computer using Microsoft Visual C++. We also created a new C++ project and wrote a simple "Hello World" program.
