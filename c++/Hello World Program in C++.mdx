## Lesson 1: Hello World Program in C++

### Introduction

C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language used to create software for a variety of purposes. The "Hello World" program is a common introduction to programming in any language, and C++ is no exception. In this lesson, we'll learn how to create a "Hello World" program in C++.

### The Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

Let's break this code down to understand what each line is doing.

The first line:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

includes the iostream header file, which gives us access to the `cout` object, which we use to output text to the console.

The second line:

```cpp
int main()
```

declares the main function, which is where our program will start executing. The `int` keyword specifies that our function will return an integer value.

The third line:

```cpp
{
```

opens a code block.

The fourth line:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello World!";
```

outputs the text "Hello World!" to the console using the `cout` object and the insertion operator `<<`.

The fifth line:

```cpp
return 0;
```

specifies that our main function will return the integer value 0.

The last line:

```cpp
}
```

closes the code block.

### Compiling and Running the Program

Now that we have our code, we need to compile and run it to see the output. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Open a text editor (such as Notepad or Sublime Text) and paste in the code above.
2. Save the file with a `.cpp` extension (such as `helloworld.cpp`).
3. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
4. Navigate to the directory where you saved your `helloworld.cpp` file.
5. Type `g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld` and press enter to compile the code. This will create an executable file called `helloworld`.
6. Type `./helloworld` and press enter to run the program.
7. You should see the message "Hello World!" printed to the console.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we've learned how to create a "Hello World" program in C++. This program is a simple introduction to the language, and is the first step in building more complex software.
