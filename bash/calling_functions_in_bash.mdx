# Module 3: Loops and Functions in Shell Scripting

## Lesson 2: Calling Functions in Bash

Welcome to the second lesson in the Loops and Functions module. In this lesson, we'll learn how to call functions in Bash scripts.

### Defining a Function

Before we can call a function, we have to define it. A function in Bash is defined using the following syntax:

```bash
function_name () {
    # function code goes here
}
```

Here's an example of a function that echoes "Hello, world!":

```bash
hello () {
    echo "Hello, world!"
}
```

### Calling a Function

Once we've defined a function, we can call it in our Bash script. To call a function, we simply use its name and parentheses:

```bash
function_name
```

Here's an example of calling the "hello" function we defined earlier:

```bash
hello
```

When we run this script, it will output "Hello, world!" to the console.

### Functions with Parameters

Functions can also take parameters, which we can use in the function code. To define a function with parameters, we include the parameter names in the function definition:

```bash
function_name () {
    parameter1=$1
    parameter2=$2
    # function code that uses parameter1 and parameter2 goes here
}
```

Here's an example of a function that takes two parameters and echoes them to the console:

```bash
greet () {
    echo "Hello, $1 and $2!"
}
```

To call this function, we simply include the parameter values in the function call:

```bash
greet Alice Bob
```

When we run this script, it will output "Hello, Alice and Bob!" to the console.

### Returning Values from Functions

Functions can also return values, which we can use in our Bash script. To return a value from a function, we simply use the "return" keyword followed by the value we want to return:

```bash
function_name () {
    # function code goes here
    return value
}
```

Here's an example of a function that returns the sum of two numbers:

```bash
sum () {
    num1=$1
    num2=$2
    total=$((num1 + num2))
    return $total
}
```

To use the returned value, we can store it in a variable:

```bash
result=$(sum 5 7)
echo $result # Output: 12
```

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned how to call functions in Bash scripts. We learned how to define functions, call functions with and without parameters, and return values from functions. By using functions, we can break our scripts down into smaller, more manageable pieces of code.
