# Module 3: Loops and Functions in Shell Scripting

## Lesson 2: For Loops in Bash

Welcome to Lesson 2 of the Loops and Functions module! In this lesson, we will learn about for loops in Bash.

### What are for loops?

For loops are used to iterate over a sequence of values. The values can be numbers, strings, or any other type that can be looped through. A for loop executes a set of commands for each value in the sequence.

In Bash, the syntax for a for loop is as follows:

```bash
for variable_name in sequence
do
    command1
    command2
    ...
done
```

- The `variable_name` represents the variable used to store each value in the sequence during each iteration of the loop.
- The `sequence` represents the set of values that the loop iterates through.
- The `commands` represent the set of statements executed during each iteration of the loop.

### Example of for loop

Let's iterate over a sequence of numbers using a for loop. In this example, we will print out the numbers from 1 to 5. We start with:

```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
    echo $i
done
```

- The `i` is the variable used to store each value in the sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
- The `echo $i` command prints the value of `i` during each iteration of the loop.

This will output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Using a for loop to loop through files

For loops can also be used to loop through files in a directory. In this example, we will use a for loop to print out all the `.txt` files in the current directory.

```bash
for file in *.txt
do
    echo $file
done
```

- The `*.txt` represents the set of `.txt` files in the current directory.
- The `echo` command prints out the name of each `.txt` file during each iteration of the loop.

### Nested for loops

We can also use nested for loops to iterate over multiple sequences inside a loop. In this example, we will iterate over two sequences of numbers using nested for loops:

```bash
for i in 1 2 3
do
    for j in 1 2 3
    do
        echo "$i $j"
    done
done
```

- The first for loop iterates over the sequence (1, 2, 3).
- The second for loop iterates over the sequence (1, 2, 3) for each value of `i`.
- The `echo` command prints out the value of `i` and `j` during each iteration of the loop.

This will output:

```
1 1
1 2
1 3
2 1
2 2
2 3
3 1
3 2
3 3
```

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about for loops in Bash. We learned how to iterate over a sequence of values using a for loop, how to loop through files in a directory, and how to use nested for loops to iterate over multiple sequences. Practice using for loops in your shell scripts to automate tasks and save time!
