# Module 5: Command Line Interface in Bash

## Lesson: Command Line Interface in Bash

Welcome to Module 5, where you'll learn how to navigate the command line interface in Bash. In this lesson, we'll talk about the basic commands and concepts for using the command line interface in Bash.

### Introduction to Bash

Bash is a shell, which is a program that allows users to interact with their operating system by entering text commands. Bash is the default shell for most Linux distributions and macOS. Windows users can also use it through the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

### The Command Line Interface

The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface for interacting with a computer's operating system. It allows you to enter commands and receive text-based feedback. The advantages of using the CLI are speed, flexibility, and scripting capabilities.

### Basic Commands

Here are some basic commands for navigating the command line interface in Bash:

1. **cd**: change directory, allows you to navigate to different directories in your file system.
   - `cd directory_name`: move to the directory with the given name.
   - `cd /path/to/directory`: move to the directory with the given absolute path.
   - `cd ..`: move up one directory.
   - `cd ~`: move to the home directory.
2. **ls**: list the files and directories in the current directory.
   - `ls`: list the files and directories in the current directory.
   - `ls -a`: list all files and directories (including hidden files).
   - `ls -l`: list files and directories in long format (shows file permissions, size, modification time, and owner).
3. **mkdir**: create a new directory.
   - `mkdir directory_name`: create a new directory with the given name.
4. **rm**: remove files and directories.
   - `rm file_name`: remove the file with the given name.
   - `rm -r directory_name`: remove the directory with the given name and all of its contents (be careful with this command).
5. **touch**: create a new file.
   - `touch file_name`: create a new file with the given name.

### Command Line Arguments

Most command line commands accept arguments. Arguments are information passed to the command that modify its behavior. Arguments are usually specified after the command, separated by a space.

For example, the `ls` command has two arguments `-a` and `-l` to modify its behavior. The `-a` flag shows all files and directories (including hidden files), and the `-l` flag shows the files and directories in long format.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we covered the basic commands and concepts for using the command line interface in Bash. We learned about Bash and the Command Line Interface, basic commands for navigating the CLI, and command line arguments. Now that you have a basic understanding of the command line interface in Bash, you are ready to start exploring your file system and writing Bash scripts.
