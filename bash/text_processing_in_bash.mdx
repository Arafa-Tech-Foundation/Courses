# Module 4: File System Operations and Text Processing in Bash

## Lesson: Text Processing in Bash

In this lesson, we will learn how to manipulate text in bash using some common text processing tools.

### Printing Text

To print text in bash, we can use the `echo` command. For example, to print the string "Hello, World!" to the console, we can run:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

We can also create variables and print their values:

```bash
my_var="Some Text"
echo $my_var
```

It's important to note that when referencing a variable, we need to use the `$` symbol before the variable name.

### Using Sed

`sed` is a text editor used to perform basic text transformations. Here are some examples of how to use `sed`:

```bash
# replace the first occurrence of "apple" with "banana"
sed 's/apple/banana/' fruits.txt

# replace all occurrences of "apple" with "banana"
sed 's/apple/banana/g' fruits.txt

# delete the first line of a file
sed '1d' file.txt

# delete a specific line number (ex: line 4)
sed '4d' file.txt

# remove all blank lines in a file
sed '/^$/d' file.txt
```

### Using Awk

`awk` is a versatile tool used for formatting and processing text data. Here are some examples of using `awk`:

```bash
# print the first column of a file
awk '{print $1}' file.txt

# print the last column of a file
awk '{print $NF}' file.txt

# print lines containing a specific pattern (ex: "apple")
awk '/apple/' fruits.txt

# calculate the sum of column 2 in a file
awk '{ total += $2 } END {print total}' file.txt
```

### Using Grep

`grep` is a command-line utility for searching plain-text files for lines that match a regular expression. Here are some examples of using `grep`:

```bash
# search for a specific string in a file
grep "search text" file.txt

# search for a pattern in a directory (subdirectories included)
grep -r "pattern" .

# print line numbers for matched strings
grep -n "search text" file.txt

# search for lines that do not contain a pattern
grep -v "pattern" file.txt
```

### Using Cut

`cut` is a command-line utility used to extract sections from each line of a file. Here are some examples:

```bash
# print the first column of a file (same as awk '{print $1}')
cut -d" " -f1 file.txt

# print the first 10 characters of each line
cut -c1-10 file.txt

# print columns 2, 4, and 6 of a file
cut -d" " -f2,4,6 file.txt
```

## Conclusion

Text processing in bash can be achieved using several command-line tools like echo, sed, awk, grep, and cut.  Knowing how to use these tools is crucial as it allows us to extract and manipulate data in plain-text files in various ways.
