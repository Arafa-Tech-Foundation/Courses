# Module 1: Introduction to Supervised Learning

## Lesson 1: Getting Started with Python Libraries

### Introduction

Welcome to the Introduction to Supervised Learning module. In this lesson, we'll learn about the Python libraries commonly used in supervised learning and how to get started with them.

### Python Libraries for Supervised Learning

There are several Python libraries that are commonly used in supervised learning. Some of the most popular ones include:

- NumPy: a library for working with arrays and mathematical operations on arrays.
- Pandas: a library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: a library for creating visualizations and plots.
- Scikit-learn: a library for machine learning algorithms.

### Installing Libraries

To install these libraries, you can use pip, Python's package manager. Open up a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
```

### Importing Libraries

Once you have installed these libraries, you can import them into your Python code using the import statement. For example:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

### Using Libraries

Let's take a look at an example of using these libraries to build a simple linear regression model. We'll use NumPy to create our data, Pandas to manipulate and analyze the data, Matplotlib to visualize the data, and Scikit-learn to build our model.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create some data
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# Create a DataFrame to hold the data
data = pd.DataFrame({'x': x, 'y': y})

# Plot the data
plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()

# Create a linear regression model and fit it to the data
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x.reshape(-1, 1), y)

# Print the model's coefficients
print('Intercept:', model.intercept_)
print('Coefficient:', model.coef_[0])

# Plot the regression line
plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.plot(x, model.predict(x.reshape(-1, 1)), color='red')
plt.show()
```

Here, we create some data using NumPy, create a DataFrame to hold the data using Pandas, plot the data using Matplotlib, create a linear regression model using Scikit-learn, fit the model to the data, print the model's coefficients, and plot the regression line using Matplotlib.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about the Python libraries commonly used in supervised learning and how to get started with them. We covered how to install and import libraries, and walked through an example of using several libraries to build a simple linear regression model. In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into the fundamentals of supervised learning.
