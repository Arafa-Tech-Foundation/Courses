# Module 2: Regression and KNN Models

## Lesson 2: Using Regression Models

Welcome to Lesson 2 of the Regression and KNN Models module. In this lesson, we'll learn about regression models and how to use them in Python.

### What is Regression?

Regression is a statistical method used to determine the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is commonly used for predicting the future values of a continuous variable based on past data.

There are several types of regression, including:

- Simple Linear Regression: used for predicting a single continuous dependent variable based on a single independent variable.
- Multiple Linear Regression: used for predicting a single continuous dependent variable based on two or more independent variables.
- Polynomial Regression: used for predicting a single continuous dependent variable based on a polynomial function of one or more independent variables.

### Simple Linear Regression

Let's start with an example of simple linear regression. Suppose we want to predict the price of a house based on its size. We have the following data:

|Size (square meters)|Price (thousands of dollars)|
|---|---|
|30|100|
|50|200|
|70|300|
|90|400|
|110|500|

We can use simple linear regression to create a model that will predict the price of a house based on its size. First, we'll import the necessary libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

Next, we'll create a Python dictionary to store our data:

```python
data = {'size': [30, 50, 70, 90, 110], 'price': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

Now, we'll create a linear regression model and fit it to our data:

```python
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(df[['size']], df['price'])
```

Finally, we can use our model to predict the price of a house based on its size:

```python
print(model.predict([[120]]))
```

This will print the predicted price of a 120 square meter house.

### Multiple Linear Regression

Now let's look at an example of multiple linear regression. Suppose we want to predict the weight of a person based on their age, height, and gender. We have the following data:

|Age|Height (inches)|Gender |Weight (pounds)|
|---|---|---|---|
|20|72|M|174|
|22|67|F|120|
|24|68|F|142|
|26|70|M|171|
|28|69|M|176|

We can use multiple linear regression to create a model that will predict the weight of a person based on their age, height, and gender. First, we'll import the necessary libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
```

Next, we'll create a Python dictionary to store our data:

```python
data = {'age': [20, 22, 24, 26, 28], 'height': [72, 67, 68, 70, 69], 'gender': ['M', 'F', 'F', 'M', 'M'], 'weight': [174, 120, 142, 171, 176]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

We need to convert the gender column to a binary representation using One Hot Encoding. We will create a new column for male and female:

```python
enc = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')
enc_df = pd.DataFrame(enc.fit_transform(df[['gender']]).toarray())
df = df.join(enc_df, rsuffix='_gender')
df.rename(columns={0: 'F', 1: 'M'}, inplace=True)
```

Now, we'll create a linear regression model and fit it to our data:

```python
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(df[['age', 'height', 'F', 'M']], df['weight'])
```

Finally, we can use our model to predict the weight of a person based on their age, height, and gender:

```python
print(model.predict([[30, 75, 0, 1]]))
```

This will print the predicted weight of a 30-year-old, 75 inch tall male.

### Polynomial Regression

Finally, let's look at an example of polynomial regression. Suppose we want to predict the number of ice cream cones sold based on the temperature. We have the following data:

|Temperature (degrees F)|Cones sold|
|---|---|
|60|150|
|65|200|
|70|250|
|75|300|
|80|350|

We can use polynomial regression to create a model that will predict the number of ice cream cones sold based on the temperature. First, we'll import the necessary libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
```

Next, we'll create a Python dictionary to store our data:

```python
data = {'temperature': [60, 65, 70, 75, 80], 'cones_sold': [150, 200, 250, 300, 350]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

Now, we'll create a polynomial regression model and fit it to our data:

```python
X = df[['temperature']]
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_poly, df['cones_sold'])
```

Finally, we can use our model to predict the number of ice cream cones sold based on the temperature:

```python
print(model.predict(poly.fit_transform([[85]])))
```

This will print the predicted number of ice cream cones sold at a temperature of 85 degrees F.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about regression models and how to use them in Python. We covered three types of regression models: simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression. We also learned how to import the necessary libraries, create dataframes, and fit models to our data.
