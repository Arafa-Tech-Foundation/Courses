# Module 1: Getting Started with JavaScript

## Lesson: Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It is used to add behavior to web pages and make them more responsive to user actions. JavaScript is also used in server-side programming with Node.js, and in building modern web applications with popular frameworks like React and Angular.

### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications in 1995, and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is a high-level, interpreted language that is designed to be easy to read and write. JavaScript code is executed in the browser, and can interact with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

### Why Learn JavaScript?

JavaScript is an essential skill for any web developer. With JavaScript, you can add interactivity and behavior to your web pages, making them more engaging for users. JavaScript is also used in server-side programming with Node.js, which allows you to build powerful and scalable web applications. Additionally, many popular front-end frameworks like React and Angular are built on top of JavaScript.

### Setting up a Development Environment

Before we can start writing JavaScript code, we need to set up a development environment. There are many tools available for writing and testing JavaScript code, but for this course, we will be using the Google Chrome browser and the built-in Developer Tools.

To access the Developer Tools in Chrome, you can right-click on any web page and select "Inspect". This will open the Developer Tools window, which includes a console where you can write and test JavaScript code.

### Basic Syntax and Data Types

Like any programming language, JavaScript has its own syntax and data types. JavaScript code is written in scripts, which are stored in HTML documents or separate files with a .js extension.

JavaScript has several built-in data types, including:

- String: a sequence of characters, enclosed in quotes (e.g. `"Hello, world!"`).
- Number: a numeric value, including integers and decimals (e.g. `42`, `3.14`).
- Boolean: a true or false value (e.g. `true`, `false`).
- Object: a collection of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces (e.g. `{name: "John", age: 30}`).
- Array: an ordered list of values, enclosed in square brackets (e.g. `[1, 2, 3]`).

### Variables and Scope

In JavaScript, variables are used to store values that can be accessed and manipulated throughout the script. Variables are declared using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords, and can be assigned any data type.

JavaScript also has the concept of scope, which determines where a variable can be accessed in the script. Variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function, while variables declared outside of a function can be accessed globally.

### Functions and Parameters

Functions are a key concept in JavaScript, and are used to encapsulate and reuse code. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task, and can be called from anywhere in the script.

Functions can also accept parameters, which are values that are passed into the function and used to modify its behavior. Parameters are defined in the function declaration, and can be of any data type.
