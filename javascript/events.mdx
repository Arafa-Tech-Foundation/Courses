# Module 2: Working with the DOM

## Lesson: Events and Event Listeners

In this lesson, we'll learn how to add event listeners to elements in the DOM using JavaScript.

### Understanding Events

Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as a user clicking a button or a page finishing loading. JavaScript can listen for these events and respond accordingly.

### Adding Event Listeners

To add an event listener to an element, you can use the `addEventListener()` method. Here's an example:

```js
const button = document.getElementById("myButton");
button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});
```

In this example, we're adding an event listener to a button element. We're listening for the "click" event, and when it occurs, we're displaying an alert message.

### Event Propagation

When an event occurs on an element, it also occurs on all of its descendants. This is called event propagation. There are two types of event propagation: bubbling and capturing.

#### Bubbling

Bubbling is the most common type of event propagation. When an event occurs on an element, it first triggers on that element, and then it "bubbles" up through its ancestors. To stop the event from bubbling, you can use the `stopPropagation()` method. Here's an example:

```js
const parent = document.getElementById("parent");
const child = document.getElementById("child");

parent.addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Parent clicked!");
});

child.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  alert("Child clicked!");
  event.stopPropagation();
});
```

In this example, we have a parent element and a child element. We're adding event listeners to both elements, and the child element is stopping the event from bubbling up to the parent element.

#### Capturing

Capturing is the opposite of bubbling. When an event occurs on an element, it first triggers on the top-level ancestor, and then it "captures" down through its descendants. Capturing is less common than bubbling, but it can be useful in certain situations.

To use capturing instead of bubbling, you can pass a third argument to `addEventListener()` with a value of `true`. Here's an example:

```js
const parent = document.getElementById("parent");
const child = document.getElementById("child");

parent.addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Parent clicked!");
}, true);

child.addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Child clicked!");
}, true);
```

In this example, we're using capturing instead of bubbling. The events trigger on the top-level ancestor (the `document` object), and then they capture down to the elements themselves.

### Removing Event Listeners

To remove an event listener from an element, you can use the `removeEventListener()` method. Here's an example:

```js
const button = document.getElementById("myButton");
const handleClick = function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
};

button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);

button.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
```

In this example, we're adding an event listener to a button element, and then we're removing it.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we've learned how to add event listeners to elements in the DOM using JavaScript. By understanding how events work and how to add and remove event listeners, you'll be able to create dynamic and interactive web pages using JavaScript.
