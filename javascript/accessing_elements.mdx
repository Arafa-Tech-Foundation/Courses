# Module 2: Working with the DOM

## Lesson: Accessing elements in the DOM

In this lesson, we'll learn how to access elements in the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript.

## What is the DOM?

The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects, that way programming languages can interact with the page.

## Accessing elements in the DOM

There are multiple ways to access elements in the DOM using JavaScript. Let's go through a few examples.

## document.getElementById()

The `getElementById()` method returns the element that has the specified ID attribute. Here's an example:

```js
const element = document.getElementById("myElement");
```

## document.getElementsByClassName()

The `getElementsByClassName()` method returns a collection of all elements in the document with the specified class name. Here's an example:

```js
const elements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");
```

## document.getElementsByTagName()

The `getElementsByTagName()` method returns a collection of all elements in the document with the specified tag name. Here's an example:

```js
const elements = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
```

## document.querySelector()

The `querySelector()` method returns the first element within the document that matches the specified selector. Here's an example:

```js
const element = document.querySelector("#myElement");
```

## document.querySelectorAll()

The `querySelectorAll()` method returns a static (not live) NodeList representing a list of the document's elements that match the specified group of selectors. Here's an example:

```js
const elements = document.querySelectorAll(".myClass");
```

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we've learned how to access elements in the DOM using JavaScript. There are many ways to access elements, and the method you choose will depend on what you need to do. By understanding how to access elements, you'll be able to manipulate them and change the content and appearance of your web page using JavaScript.
