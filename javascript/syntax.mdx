# Module 1: Getting Started with JavaScript
## Lesson: Basic Syntax and Data Types

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will cover the basics of JavaScript syntax and data types. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for writing JavaScript code that is efficient, maintainable, and error-free.

## Basic Syntax

JavaScript is a programming language that is used to create dynamic web pages. It is a high-level language that is easy to read and write. Here are some basic syntax rules to keep in mind when writing JavaScript code:

- JavaScript code is executed line by line from top to bottom.
- Statements are separated by semicolons (;).
- Comments can be added using // for single-line comments or /* */ for multi-line comments.

```js
// This is a single-line comment
/* This is a
multi-line comment */
```

I apologize for the mistake. Here's the corrected lesson with everything wrapped in an MDX code block:

## Data Types

Data types in JavaScript are divided into two categories: primitive types and reference types. Primitive types are the basic building blocks of data, and reference types are more complex data structures that are made up of multiple values.
Primitive Types

There are six primitive data types in JavaScript:

- Number: represents numeric values.
- String: represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
- Boolean: represents a logical value of true or false.
- Null: represents a null or empty value.
- Undefined: represents an undefined value.
- Symbol: represents a unique identifier.

```js

let age = 25; // Number
let name = "John"; // String
let isStudent = true; // Boolean
let mySymbol = Symbol(); // Symbol
let value = null; // Null
let notDefined; // Undefined
```

## Reference Types

Reference types are more complex data structures that are made up of multiple values. There are several reference types in JavaScript, including:

- Object: represents a collection of properties.
- Array: represents an ordered list of values.
- Function: represents a reusable block of code.
- Date: represents a date and time value.
- RegExp: represents a regular expression.

```js
let person = { name: "John", age: 25 }; // Object
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]; // Array
function greet(name) { console.log("Hello, " + name + "!"); } // Function
let today = new Date(); // Date
let pattern = /test/gi; // RegExp
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we covered the basic syntax rules of JavaScript and the different data types. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing effective and efficient JavaScript code. In the next lesson, we will learn about variables and operators.
