# Module 3: Best Practices in JavaScript

## Lesson: Avoiding Common Mistakes

In this lesson, we'll learn about some common mistakes in JavaScript and how to avoid them.

### Mistake: Forgetting to Declare Variables

If you forget to declare a variable using `var`, `let`, or `const`, it will be created as a global variable. This can cause problems when you have multiple functions and variables with the same name.

```js
function foo() {
  myVar = 10; // Forgot to declare myVar with var, let, or const
}

function bar() {
  var myVar = 20;
  console.log(myVar); // Will output 20
  console.log(window.myVar); // Will output 10 (the global variable)
}
```

### Solution: Always Declare Variables

Always declare your variables using `var`, `let`, or `const` to avoid creating global variables by accident.

### Mistake: Using == instead of ===

Using `==` instead of `===` can cause unexpected behavior because `==` performs type coercion.

```js
console.log(5 == "5"); // Will output true
console.log(5 === "5"); // Will output false
```

### Solution: Use === Instead of ==

Always use `===` to avoid unexpected behavior caused by type coercion.

### Mistake: Not Using Strict Mode

Strict mode is a mode in which JavaScript is executed in a stricter way, which helps catch common coding mistakes and unsafe actions.

```js
function myFunction() {
  x = 3.14; // Forgot to declare x with var, let, or const
  return x;
}

console.log(myFunction()); // Will output 3.14
```

### Solution: Use Strict Mode

Always use strict mode in your JavaScript code to catch common coding mistakes and unsafe actions.

```js
"use strict";

function myFunction() {
  x = 3.14; // Will throw an error because x is not declared
  return x;
}

console.log(myFunction()); // Will throw an error
```

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we've learned about some common mistakes in JavaScript and how to avoid them. By always declaring our variables, using `===` instead of `==`, and using strict mode in our code, we can write code that is less error-prone and easier to maintain.
