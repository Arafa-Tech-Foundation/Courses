# Module 1: Getting Started with JavaScript

## Lesson: Setting up a Development Environment

## Introduction

Before we can start writing JavaScript code, we need to set up a development environment. This lesson will guide you through the process of setting up a development environment for JavaScript programming.

## Text Editor

The first thing you need to do is choose a text editor. A text editor is a software program that is used to write and edit text files. There are many text editors available, some are free and some require payment. Here are a few popular options:

- **Visual Studio Code** (Free)
- **Sublime Text** (Paid)
- **Atom** (Free)
- **Notepad++** (Free)

In this course, we will be using Visual Studio Code as our text editor.

## Installing Visual Studio Code

To install Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Click on the download button for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Once the download is complete, run the installer.
4. Follow the prompts to complete the installation process.

## Installing Node.js

Next, we need to install Node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. We need Node.js to run JavaScript code on our computer. To install Node.js, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Click on the download button for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Once the download is complete, run the installer.
4. Follow the prompts to complete the installation process.

## Setting up a Local Development Environment

Now that we have Visual Studio Code and Node.js installed, we can set up a local development environment. A local development environment is a setup on your own computer that allows you to write and test your code locally before deploying it to a server.

To set up a local development environment, follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder for your project.
2. Open Visual Studio Code and click on "File" > "Open Folder". Navigate to the folder you just created and select it.
3. In Visual Studio Code, click on "Terminal" > "New Terminal". This will open a new terminal window at the bottom of the screen.
4. In the terminal window, type `node -v` to check that Node.js was installed correctly. You should see the version number of Node.js displayed in the terminal window.
5. Create a new file in Visual Studio Code by clicking on "File" > "New File". Name the file "index.js".
6. Type the following code into the "index.js" file:

   ```js
   console.log("Hello, World!");
   ```

7. Save the file by clicking on "File" > "Save As" and selecting the project folder you created earlier.
8. In the terminal window, type node index.js to run the code. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed in the terminal window.

Congratulations, you have set up your local development environment and run your first JavaScript program!

## Conclusion

Setting up a development environment is an essential step in JavaScript programming. In this lesson, you learned how to install Visual Studio Code and Node.js, and how to set up a local development environment. In the next lesson, we will learn about the basics of JavaScript syntax.
