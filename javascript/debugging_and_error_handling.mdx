# Lesson: Debugging and Error Handling

In this lesson, we'll learn about best practices for debugging and error handling in JavaScript.

## Use console.log() to Debug Your Code

console.log() is a useful tool for debugging your code. You can use it to print values to the console and see what's happening in your code.

```js
function calculateTotal(price, taxRate) {
  console.log(price, taxRate); // Use console.log() to see the values of the arguments
  const total = price + (price * taxRate);
  console.log(total); // Use console.log() to see the value of the total
  return total;
}
```

## Use try...catch Blocks for Error Handling

try...catch blocks are used for error handling in JavaScript. You can use them to catch errors and handle them in a way that makes sense for your application.

```js
try {
  // Some code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error
  console.log(error.message);
}
```

## Use Meaningful Error Messages

When handling errors, it's important to use meaningful error messages. This helps other developers understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

```js
try {
  // Some code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error with a meaningful message
  console.log("An error occurred:", error.message);
}
```

## Use a Linter to Catch Errors Early

A linter is a tool that checks your code for errors and potential issues. Using a linter can help you catch errors early and ensure that your code follows best practices.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we've learned about best practices for debugging and error handling in JavaScript. By using console.log() to debug your code, try...catch blocks for error handling, meaningful error messages, and a linter to catch errors early, you'll be able to write code that is easier to debug and maintain.
