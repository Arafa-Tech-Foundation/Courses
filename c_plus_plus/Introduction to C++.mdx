# Module 1: Getting Started with C++

## Lesson: Introduction to C++

### What is C++?

C++ is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is used to develop a wide range of applications, including video games, operating systems, web browsers, and database software. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language.

C++ is known for its performance, flexibility, and ability to directly manipulate hardware, making it a popular choice for programming systems and applications that require high performance.

### Setting up an Environment

Before we dive into coding with C++, we need to set up an environment. There are several options available for setting up a C++ development environment, but for this lesson, we will be using the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE.

#### Installing Microsoft Visual Studio

1. Go to the [Microsoft Visual Studio website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and navigate to the download page for the Community edition of Visual Studio.
2. Click the "Download" button to download the install file.
3. Open the install file and follow the on-screen instructions to install Visual Studio.

#### Creating a New Project

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Click "Create a new project".
3. Select "Visual C++" from the left menu and choose "Console App" from the options.
4. Enter a name for your project and choose a location to save it.
5. Choose the "Desktop development with C++" workload and click "Create".

Congratulations! You have now set up a C++ development environment and created your first project!

### Basic Concepts

#### Variables

A variable is a named memory location that can hold a value. In C++, variables must be declared before they can be used. Here is an example of creating and initializing a variable:

```c++
int age = 25;
```

In this example, we declare an integer variable called "age" and initialize it to the value 25.

#### Data Types

C++ has several built-in data types, including integer, float, double, and char. Here are some examples of declaring variables with different data types:

```c++
int num = 10;
float pi = 3.14;
double distance = 2.5e8;
char letter = 'a';
```

In this example, we declare variables of different data types and initialize them with values.

#### Operators

C++ has several types of operators, including arithmetic, logic, and relational. Here are some examples of using operators:

```c++
int x = 10;
int y = 5;
int sum = x + y; // adds x and y
bool greaterThan = x > y; // checks if x is greater than y
int modulus = x % y; // calculates the remainder of x divided by y
```

In this example, we use different types of operators to perform calculations and comparisons.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about what C++ is and how to set up a development environment. We also covered some basic concepts such as variables, data types, and operators. 

To get started with C++, it's important to practice writing code and familiarizing yourself with the language. Here are some resources to help you get started:

- [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/) - a comprehensive website with tutorials, articles, and a reference for C++.
- [Codecademy C++ course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus) - a free online course that teaches the basics of C++.
- [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) - a website with tutorials and exercises for learning C++. 

With practice and dedication, you can become proficient in C++ and start building your own applications!
