# Module 7: Conclusion
## Lesson: Best Practices in C++ Development

As we conclude the course on C++ development, it is important to highlight some of the best practices that have been discussed in this course. These practices are essential for any new or seasoned developer to consider when writing C++ code. They ensure that the code is maintainable, efficient, and secure.

### 1. Organizing code
Organizing code is crucial for ensuring that code is easy to read and understand. In C++, code should be organized in files that have a clear structure. A common way to do this is to separate code into header files and source files. Header files contain declarations of classes, functions, and variables, while source files contain their implementations. This separation allows for reuse of code and easier debugging. Additionally, the code should follow a consistent style guide such as the Google C++ Style Guide.

### 2. Memory management
Memory management is a critical aspect of C++ development. The language provides the ability to manually allocate and free memory, which can lead to memory leaks or dangling pointers if not properly managed. To avoid these issues, developers should use smart pointers such as `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`. These provide automatic memory management, ensuring that memory is properly deallocated once it is no longer in use.

```c++
#include <memory>

void smartPointerExample(){
  // std::unique_ptr example
  std::unique_ptr<int> ptr1 = std::make_unique<int>(10);
  std::unique_ptr<int> ptr2 = std::move(ptr1); // Transfer ownership of ptr1 to ptr2
  if (ptr1 == nullptr) {
    std::cout << "ptr1 is nullptr" << std::endl;
  }
  
  // std::shared_ptr example
  std::shared_ptr<int> ptr3 = std::make_shared<int>(20);
  std::shared_ptr<int> ptr4 = ptr3; // Increase reference count of ptr3 by 1
  if (ptr3.use_count() == 2) {
    std::cout << "ptr3 is shared" << std::endl;
  }
} 
```

### 3. Error handling
C++ has a try-catch block that can be used for error handling. When an exception is thrown, the program unwinds the stack and looks for a catch block that can handle the exception. Developers should avoid using exceptions for control flow as they can lead to code that is hard to follow and debug.

```c++
#include <stdexcept>

void errorHandlingExample(){
  try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
    throw std::runtime_error("Error");
  }
  catch (std::runtime_error& e) {
    std::cout << e.what() << std::endl; // Print error message
  }
  catch (...) {
    std::cout << "Unknown error" << std::endl;
  }
}
```

### 4. Performance optimization
Performance optimization is an important consideration in C++. To achieve optimal performance, developers should use the following techniques:

- Avoid unnecessary copying of objects
- Allocate memory outside loops
- Use move semantics
- Use constexpr and templates when possible

```c++
#include <vector>

void performanceOptimizationExample(){
  std::vector<int> src = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
  std::vector<int> dst;
  
  // Avoid unnecessary copying of objects
  dst.reserve(src.size());
  
  // Allocate memory outside loops
  for (const auto& i : src) {
    dst.push_back(i);
  }
  
  // Use move semantics
  std::vector<int> src2 = { 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
  std::vector<int> dst2 = std::move(src2);
  
  // Use constexpr and templates
  constexpr int N = 10;
  std::array<int, N> arrayExample;
}
```

### 5. Security
Developers should also consider security when writing C++ code. The language provides the ability to write code that can contain buffer overflows or injection attacks. To avoid this, developers should use proper input validation, memory management, and avoid using `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `scanf`.
